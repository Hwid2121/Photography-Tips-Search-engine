So we plod forward, skipping the keywording step and relying on our fuzzy memories to scan through libraries looking for the images we want. But what if we could get descriptive keywords without entering them ourselves? That’s the promise of ", ", a new utility that uses AI technologies to identify scenes and objects in images and create relevant keywords.", "The big players have turned to AI to bypass the keywording stage, but in an often frustrating, opaque way. Apple Photos, Google Photos, and Adobe Lightroom (the desktop and mobile versions, not Lightroom Classic), for example, all scan your images for things the machine learning models recognize. The upside is that you can search for things like “leaves” or “cloudy skies” or “cars” and usually get results that contain the items, even if the images were never specifically tagged with those terms.", "The downside is that you don’t know which objects or characteristics are associated with any given photo. You’re going on faith that the app or service is doing a good job. Did the software grab ", " image in your library that contains a car? What about less tangible terms? A recent search for “snow” in Apple Photos brought up snowy scenes, but also a black and white photo and an image of pale rock formations in the summer.", "ON1 Photo Keyword AI does the same type of scanning, but presents the actual keywords it generated and adds them to photos in a transparent way.", "How ON1 Photo Keyword AI works", "ON1 Photo Keyword AI is a standalone app built on ON1’s browsing and catalog technology that undergirds its flagship ", " editor. (In fact, the latest release, ON1 Photo RAW 2023.5, incorporates the Photo Keyword AI features.) Unlike the company’s other individual tools, this one is not available as a plug-in for other apps such as Lightroom Classic, though there is a way to make it work with other apps (which we’ll get to later).", " is a standalone purchase retailing for $69.99, which includes activation on up to two computers, and is available for macOS and Windows systems.", "To get started in ON1 Photo Keyword AI, you browse to a folder of images on disk, and then select one or more photos to scan.", "In the Metadata panel at right, expand the AI Keywords section (if it’s not visible) and click the Scan button. The app reviews the image(s) and builds a set of keywords that appear in the field below.", "It’s important to point out that the scanning happens locally; images are not uploaded to a cloud processor or used for further machine learning training. The scanning time depends on the capabilities of your computer and the number of images selected for scanning. On a 2021 MacBook Pro with an M1 Max processor and 32 GB of memory, scanning a single image took a few seconds. Processing a folder of 74 raw images took just under 6 minutes. A batch of 500 photos from an event containing numerous people took about 38 minutes.", "By default, the generated keywords are automatically applied to the photos, either embedded directly into the image files (for formats such as JPEG) or written to .XMP sidecar files (for raw images). You can see the terms added in the Keywords field.", "Alternatively, you can choose to add the keywords manually by turning off the Automatically Embed Metadata setting. In that case, clicking the arrow icon on a suggested keyword adds it to the selected image(s). (Clicking the X that appears when you mouse over a suggested keyword removes it from the AI Keywords field.)", "Or, if you’re satisfied with the results of a scan, you can click Add All to tag the photo(s) with every found keyword. Be aware, though, that if multiple images are selected, they each get ", " the terms, even ones that were not suggested for specific photos. For example, if a person appears in one image but not another, and they’re both selected, clicking Add All tags both photos with the “Person” keyword.", "In addition to working with photos on your drives, ON1 Photo Keyword AI can scan images as you import them from a camera or memory card, front-loading the keyword process in your workflow. They get saved to a folder of your choice and tagged with the discovered keywords; if you use an app for organizing your library that recognizes XMP files, the keywords should appear when you add the photos.", "Keyword quality", "One of the values of an app like this is the ability to make suggestions you may not consider. For instance, a photo of a person taking a photo of trees brings up descriptors such as “Outerwear,” “Backpack,” and “Luggage and bags” in addition to expected terms like “Person” and “Tree.” It also pulls words from metadata such as the location-based “Stehekin” (a town name) and “Chelan County” where the image was captured, if the GPS data is already embedded in the image file.", "That said, the app does tend to throw everything it finds at that Keyword field. Is it important that a series of photos contain the term “Biome” or “Habitat”? Probably not. In our testing it also tended to mark many animals as “Bear” and added “Carnivore” to the mix. Your pet may indeed be a carnivore, but that doesn’t seem like a keyword you’d often search for when trying to locate images of your cat FluffySnuggles. (Counterpoint: cats.) As another example, we also ran instances where scanning portraits and photos specifically including people served up keywords such as “Human arm,” “Human hair,” “Finger,” “Organ (Biology),” and “Human action.”", "It’s easy to make fun of such results because our brains automatically sort out unnecessary terms when we’re evaluating photos. The machine learning models are designed to describe the contents of scenes based on what the models have been exposed to previously. Honestly, it’s probably better to include too many keywords than too few.", "And some of those terms are helpful, such as marking images that have “1 Face” or “2 Faces.” The app does a good job of estimating general ages, making it possible to identify photos that contain “Child,” “Teenager/Young Adult,” or “Elderly” subjects. However, although it can discern when people are in the frame, the app isn’t doing any person recognition. It would be helpful to tag all selected images that contain your friends John or Clara, for instance.", "If that’s too much, the ON1 Photo Keyword AI settings include general categories that can be turned on or off, such as Photographic Properties and Histogram Properties.", "For terms the software didn’t generate, you can type new keywords and append them to the selected images. You can also remove terms you don’t want, although with the default settings it's a two-step affair: you must first remove the term from the AI Keywords field (by clicking the X that appears on its icon) and then deleting it from the Keywords field. You can scroll down through the Keyword List, which is the database of all keywords collected or generated, and deselect or delete terms, but that’s a lot of steps.", "Interacting with other apps", "If you use another app to manage your photo library, you have a few options for integrating ON1 Photo Keyword AI into your workflow. One approach would be to import photos from the camera or memory card directly into ON1 Photo Keyword AI (or copy them to your drive and open them in the app), scan for keywords, and then import the processed files in your library manager.", "Or, if the photos are already in your library, process the files using ON1 Photo Keyword AI and synchronize the metadata in the library app. For example, you can navigate to a folder that Lightroom Classic already tracks, and then scan the images, which by default embeds the keywords. Lightroom tends to be cautious about blindly updating files it already watches, so you need to manually synchronize the images’ metadata with what’s on disk.", "When you see the icon on photos indicating that the metadata on disk is different from what Lightroom expects, click it and choose to overwrite the metadata from disk.", "In Capture One, as another example, you’d select the images that were processed in ON1 Photo Keyword AI, right-click, and choose Sync Metadata from the contextual menu. Apple Photos, on the other hand, ignores XMP files, so keywords will only appear in photos where the terms have been written to the image file, such as JPEG or DNG images.", "Metadata manager", "Although the AI scanning is the app’s headlining feature, ON1 Photo Keyword AI is also a full metadata manager, including star ratings, flags, color labels, and IPTC data. There’s also a Map view and the ability to compare photos when evaluating how to rate them. Basically, you could do all of your sorting and culling in ON1 Photo Keyword AI before passing the photos along to the image editor of your choice.", "The app builds a database of keywords you’ve used and that have been generated, which are editable in the Keyword List. Misspell a keyword you entered? It can be corrected here, which applies the change to any photo the app tracks. (If the photos were previously added to your photo editor, such as Lightroom Classic, you would need to synchronize the metadata again.)", "You can also create Cataloged Folders for frequently-used folders (like a portfolio you add images to regularly), which caches the metadata for faster performance within ON1 Photo Keyword AI, reducing the reliance on reading data from every file on disk.", "Let the machine do it", "Generating keywords seems like a perfect task for AI. It’s coming up with terms, many that you may not have thought to add, and applying them to many images in a short amount of time. Granted, as with any current AI technology, the results that appear after a scan get you most of the way there–you may end up adding some specific terms and deleting others to match what the software may have missed or which are specific to your needs (like moods or event names). The advantage is having many valid terms to work with instead of nothing at all.", "In our testing, we found that adding a separate utility dedicated to keywording required us to reevaluate our workflows. Running ON1 Photo Keyword AI and synchronizing the metadata in Lightroom Classic is an extra step beyond our usual approach of adding keywords during the import stage. (If you already use ON1 Photo RAW as your library manager and photo editor, the feature is already built in.) However, having more metadata–particularly terms we don't have to come up with ourselves–makes the addition worthwhile. And especially if you don't currently apply any keywords to your photos (but know that you probably should), throwing the app into your workflow ends up giving you plenty of searchable metadata with very little work.", "If, on the other hand, you're fastidious about the keywords you apply, ON1 Photo Keyword AI might be overkill, or at least overwhelming. You'll likely need to add context-specific keywords to the mostly generic terms that the software adds. For instance, in a recent scan ON1 Photo Keyword AI correctly determined that a photo included birds, but wasn't savvy enough to identify that they were flamingos. But that's something you would have added anyway without using a separate utility for generating the keywords."], "url": "https://www.dpreview.com/articles/9024727082/on1-photo-keyword-ai-2023-hands-on"},

It is notoriously difficult finding parking around this area, so I drove around for a while and finally found a spot in the middle of the block on Stratford Ave. As I walked to the corner of Westchester Ave., I saw people gathering in the middle of the street. Once I got closer, I saw kids playing around an open pump. The day was hot, and I wasn't surprised people were trying to cool off. When I got closer, I saw a giant turtle near the few kids splashing by the pump. It looked like a turtle you would see in a zoo. It wasn't a typical thing to see, but living in the Bronx not completely unexpected.", "The owner was there, clearly enjoying the commotion he created with his pet. He wore a navy blue Kangol hat, long dark denim shorts, black sneakers and a white t-shirt rolled around his neck. 'It's hot today. We all gotta cool down,' the smiling owner said.", "I immediately thought of photographing what was happening, but since I was in a hurry, I told myself I would get the shot once I got my father's meds. After living in the Bronx for as long as I had, I was confident the scene would be there when I came out. Once I finished my errand, I walked back to my car and saw the turtle had made its way down the block. I loved seeing how people reacted to this giant turtle casually strolling the street. I positioned myself to have the turtle in the foreground and the spectators in the background.", "When I walked up to the scene of this giant turtle taking a casual stroll in my neighborhood, it immediately felt like a quintessential Bronx moment. It was a unique and unexpected happening, but it also was hilarious. I wanted to document the pleasant surprises you can find in the Bronx.", "I only took two frames of the scene. The moment was so unique I didn't think I had to take too many photos. At the time, I also didn't think I would wind up posting it on Instagram and that it would become my most popular print.", "This early experience is what taught me to ALWAYS carry my camera. The only thing I had on me at the time was my iPhone 4S. I took out my phone and took the frames. Back in 2014, images taken on cell phones were not considered as serious as if taken with a camera. I had just started photography and had deeply immersed myself in learning all documentary photo rules. I was saving for my first professional camera, and all I had on me was a phone.", "I also learned that you should not shy away from making art just because you don't have the most up-to-date equipment. Being a photographer is very expensive and, therefore, elitist. I believe phone cameras have allowed the average person not just to document their lives in an affordable manner but also opened up opportunities for people to express themselves artistically.", "Seeing the turtle out and about had made such a commotion with passersby that I knew the magic of the shot would come from the residents' reactions. I positioned myself to ensure I included people reacting to what they saw. This shot was the second one I took, and I knew I had something with the two young men looking at the turtle.", "Only later, when I looked at it closer, did I realize how special it was. I particularly love the young man in the colorful shirt. His facial expression of disbelief spoke for all of us. He had turned so quickly to see the turtle in the middle of the street that I caught his chain suspended mid-air. Both young men looked bewildered by what they saw, but in very typical Bronx style, kept it moving and didn't stop to investigate further. I also love the opposite directions the young men and the turtle were taking. Their stories merge at this magical point and then move on.", "The owner of the turtle is out of frame. He was incredibly proud of his pet and enjoyed showing it off. He gladly answered questions from curious onlookers about the turtle. He seemed knowledgeable about the type of turtle it was and how he had only let it walk on the pavement because the hydrant was open and the pavement was wet. He said it was a warm day, and he wanted the turtle to cool off. After a few minutes and taking the two frames, I also was on my way. It was yet another unique Bronx moment that I felt so lucky to have witnessed.", "One, don't get intimidated by what type of equipment you have. The best tool you will ever have is your imagination and your love for the community. Second, stay positive. It is hard to see the beauty around us if we are not connected to seeking it out. This is a hard ask, especially during these difficult times, but talent is fueled by interest and curiosity.

In other words, when we have a full moon happen at the same time as when the Moon is at its closest point near the Earth, we get a 'supermoon'.", "NASA Armstrong Flight Research Center photographer Lauren Hughes takes photos of the Super Blue Blood Moon eclipse from California’s Trona Pinnacles Desert National Conservation for the Jan. 31 of the total lunar eclipse that provided a rare opportunity to capture a supermoon, a blue moon and a lunar eclipse at the same time.", "The reason for this phenomenon is due to the fact that the Moon's orbit is not perfectly circular but rather elliptical. There are points during this oval-shaped orbit where the Moon is the furthest away from the Earth, the apogee, and then closest to the Earth, the perigee. From our perspective here on Earth, the Moon's apparent size fluctuates during this orbit as it gets closer and farther away from us. During a supermoon, the Moon can appear about eight percent larger and approximately 16 percent brighter than a typical full moon. Compared to full moons that occur at the farthest distance from Earth (at the apogee), supermoons appear about ", ".", "However, this upcoming August 30th supermoon is notable for a couple of reasons. For one, this will be the biggest and brightest supermoon of the year, as the Moon is coming particularly close to the Earth, at 357,344 km (222,043 miles) – or about 27,359 km (17,000 miles) closer than average.", "A supermoon, is seen as it rises behind the U.S. Capitol, Monday, March 9, 2020, in Washington, DC.", "The second special thing about this upcoming supermoon is what gives it its unique name as a 'blue supermoon'. You may recognize the phrase 'once in a blue moon'. It's an idiom used to describe a rare but repeating event. A 'blue moon' happens when you have two full moons during the same month. We had a full moon on August 1st, and we'll have another one again on August 31st. In an astronomical sense, a blue moon isn't, despite the idiom, all that rare. They happen about every two and a half years or so. However, a blue supermoon is, in fact, much more uncommon. The last blue supermoon occurred in December 2009, and after the one at the end of the month, we won't see another one until August 2032. Yes, 2032. Fingers crossed for good weather and clear skies!", "So, it goes without saying that capturing some beautiful photos of the blue supermoon would make for a special treat.", "Most will tell you there's no inherently right or wrong way to photograph any subject. We photographers all have our own unique perspectives, visions and creative styles in how we approach making a photograph. There are a plethora of ways to photograph the upcoming supermoon, and there's not one correct way to do it necessarily.", "During the supermoon, you can, of course, capture excellent shots of the Moon just on its own in the night sky. The procedure for capturing this type of photo is pretty straightforward and is the same as how I would approach taking photos of a regular full moon. However, given the supermoon's characteristic larger and, well, ", " appearance compared to a regular full moon, classic supermoon photographs tend to be shot in a way that emphasizes the size of the Moon through perspective, juxtaposing it against the surroundings.", "Get up close and person to the moon with a long, telephoto lens. Taken with an OM-1 and the 300mm F4 Pro + 1.4x teleconverter, this is a good image of the Moon itself alone in the night sky. However, it lacks any sort of context or foreground objects to give the Moon a sense of scale to showcase its sheer size.", "For starters, a word about exposure settings: the Moon, super or otherwise, is surprisingly bright. Unlike typical night-sky photography, you won't need a super-fast aperture lens or high ISOs. For the Moon, you'll want the opposite. Start at ISO 100, and don't be afraid to stop your lens down some. You may also need to dial back the exposure, either through manual exposure mode or by using exposure compensation, to keep the Moon from being overexposed against the darker evening or night sky.", "For lunar photography, it does help to have some specialized equipment, namely, a long telephoto lens – something around 300-400mm is a great starting point, but I've gone even longer, such as 600mm-equivalent with my ", " lens. Even a ", " with a far-reaching, built-in zoom lens can work well, too.", "Another key piece of gear is a tripod. While many modern cameras have fantastic image stabilization, you'll have better results with a sturdy, solid tripod in this situation.", "Taking a shot of the Moon in the dark night sky is all fine and good, but to really emphasize the supermoon, it's best to juxtapose it with some buildings, terrain or other objects in the foreground to give the Moon a sense of scale. Let your creativity run free. You could capture a shot of the huge supermoon peeking out from behind skyscrapers downtown or perhaps have some trees silhouetted in front of a giant orange moon. It's up to you and what your surroundings have to offer.", "A supermoon rises behind the Washington Monument, Sunday, June 23, 2013, in Washington.", "To get that low-to-the-horizon composition or that vibrant, orange glow to the Moon, you'll need to time your shooting during the early moonrise period in the late evening. Having the Moon just peeking over the horizon gives you a better chance to get the classic shots with objects in the foreground. Plus, due to the Earth's atmosphere, much like with the 'golden hour' during sunset, the Moon will take on those golden, yellow or orange hues. When it's lower to the horizon, light reflecting off the Moon travels a longer distance through the atmosphere. During that time, the bluer, shorter wavelengths of light are scattered away, leaving more of the ", ".", "But where will the Moon be relative to my location? Where do I need to go to get a good shot? One way to help plan your composition is to use apps like the ", " or ", ". These apps will let you map out your location and give you the time, angle and other critical details as to where the Moon will be at a specific point and what angle you'll need to face.", "If you have an idea of where to shoot, I'd also recommend doing a little reconnaissance mission a day or so beforehand, if possible. That will help you plan the ideal location, where to place your camera and give you a sense of what the landscape looks like and what subjects or objects you can incorporate in your supermoon composition.", "Lastly, one more tip about composition. You'll want to use your telephoto lens or the longest lens you get your hands on. Ideally, you'll also want the objects, whether trees, a hillside or a building, far off in the distance. You'll use your telephoto lens to help compress the scene, bringing the far-away object(s) and the supermoon up close. The perspective compression offered by the telephoto focal length helps accentuate the size of the Moon, providing a kind of optical illusion effect in terms of the sense of scale compared to the foreground scene.", "Have you taken photos of the supermoon before?

Here are some tips and insights for you to consider (or disregard, I’m not precious) when embarking on your own photography journey.", "For this first lesson, I’m not talking about ghostly HDR images generated at the click of a button by combining bracketed exposures. I’m talking about setting Lightroom sliders to -100 highlights and +100 shadows.", "Because when we extend an image’s dynamic range as far as possible, we lose contrast and lessen the dynamism in the scene.", "Viewers have certain, if subconscious, expectations when they see your image. Like the fact that patches of light are going to be bright, while the shadows behind an object should remain dark.", "When you even out those extremes too much, your image will become flat—losing the sense of depth and realism that natural contrast would have otherwise created.", "To highlight the importance of natural contrast that viewers will expect, consider these two scenarios:", " You’re at a scenic mountain lookout. The ridges in the background are hazy, while the trees and rocks in front of you have more contrast. This dynamic is the natural way of things, where more distant objects gain haze and lose contrast. If you boost your shadows to their very extreme, you’ll lose that organic feeling of depth through your two-dimensional image.", " You’re shooting a sunrise seascape. Don’t forget that the sun is a giant ball of incredibly bright, hot plasma. If you underexpose and crush the highlights, they’ll appear muddy and unnatural. Likewise, use an overexposed frame—either through luminosity masks or HDR blending—for the darkest shadows sparingly. (A little bit will help to retain subtle textures, but too much will introduce light where there shouldn't be any.)", "The takeaway: extend the dynamic range in your images to preserve details in the brightest whites and the darkest blacks. But only do so in moderation.", "Like many, I was drawn to landscape photography by bold explosions of color across the sky. Whether on a vacation or gazing out the window on a commute home, a spectacular sunset simply beckons to be captured.", "Unsurprisingly, my early forays into landscape photography would send me down to the beach before dawn. I’d set my camera behind a sea stack and wait for the sky to do its thing.", "Looking back, I think this approach harmed my development on two levels.", "Firstly, expectations soon morphed into frustrations when the sky fizzled out. Even if the sky partially caught fire, my mind would drift to ‘what could have been’. ", "And faced with that potential frustration, I simply chose to avoid disappointment altogether. If there wasn't a solid chance of a brilliant sunrise, I wouldn’t go out at all. I deprived myself of valuable learning opportunities to work with the light that was available.", "Secondly, this mindset created severe tunnel vision. All my efforts became focused on the sky. I directed my attention on that one element—and missed other frames later in the day or even that same morning.", "All too often, after the sunrise clouds had turned red and orange I’d pack up and head home.", "But as I’ve experienced more scenes and become more open to a wider range of potential vistas, I’ve embraced shooting throughout the day. The sky won’t be as ‘epic’ as it can be at dawn and dusk. But broadening my shooting window from 30 minutes to many hours throughout the day has enabled me to capture and create a much more diverse range of images.", "Look for patches of light rolling across the hillsides. Dappled light drifting through the forest. Or light reflecting off a glowing rock face. Spectacular skies are great. But that doesn’t mean your images have to revolve around them.", "I’m not one to dole out rigid rules that you need to adhere to, or else. But this third lesson is the closest I’ll come to telling you what to do.", "Odds are, your default shutter speed for long exposures is too long. And for many years, I was guilty of this offense too. For waterfall and river scenes, I’d stick on a 6-stop ND filter and slow my shutter speed down to over a second. For seascapes, I’d hover around 1/2 second to create silky smooth water as waves rushed around boulders and down channels.", "The problem? The water would turn to mush. The longer the water movement is averaged out, the more texture you’ll lose, until all you’re left with is a featureless milky bath.", "If you’re looking to create some ethereal Middle Earth waterfall scene or a glass-like reflection, stick on your ND filter and call me names in the comments. But if you want to capture a realistic feeling of motion in your image, leave your ND filters at home.", "The actual shutter speed will vary depending on your distance to the water and how fast it’s flowing. I’ve found that starting at 1/4 second and speeding that up to about 1/10 second (particularly for crashing waves) is a good starting point.", "Don’t anchor yourself to 1/2 second and stay there throughout the session. Instead, experiment with faster speeds and review what looks best. And capture that feeling of energy you experienced on location in your static image.", "Landscape photographers—and photographers more broadly—are at the mercy of the conditions we find ourselves in.

The odds could be in your favor while the rest of us hit snooze on the alarm.", "As I developed as a photographer, I went through a series of stages.", "Early on, I would focus and rely on the sky—see Lesson 2. Then I became more mindful of foregrounds to add context to and depth throughout a scene. Then I paid closer attention to subtle compositional choices, like balance and framing.", "Now I've found that a telephoto lens allows me to best distill the essence of a place. At longer focal lengths we have precise control over what makes it into the scene—and what doesn’t.", "And we can be incredibly creative too. Rising a couple of steps in elevation could eliminate distracting patches of white sky behind a forest scene. While zooming in a few extra millimeters might exclude distractions just outside of the frame.", "The creative decisions at our disposal are endless.", "With a wide angle, we can simply point our camera at a scenic view and be guaranteed a pretty picture. With a telephoto, we can home in on essential elements. Eliminate distractions.

I even shot JPEG for the first time in eight years.", "It was a hard slog at times, with many missed frames and soft shots. But I kept at it. With each outing, I honed my eye and expanded my capabilities. And when I travelled to Vietnam recently, I captured some street scenes I’m proud of.", "I remain a landscape photographer at heart. Yet from this street photography immersion I’ve learned several lessons and skills that I’ve been able to apply in my landscape photography, that I'd like to share with you. Let’s jump in.", "We landscape photographers often travel to locations – both new and familiar – with preconceived ideas about what we want to shoot. Perhaps we’ve tracked the clouds all day and the sunset is scheduled to explode in color. Or recent rains promise that a nearby waterfall will be flowing nicely.", "But then we arrive. And too many low clouds roll in, blocking the evening light. Or the sheer volume of rain has churned the river into rapids. It’s easy to become frustrated. Particularly if we’ve come a long way, or if this was our one chance to shoot the scene before we have to return home.", "Street photography has taught me a different approach. On the sidewalk, conditions are constantly changing. The experience is fast-paced and highly variable. Your only option is to adapt. Yes, you can find a compelling frame and wait in place until a stylish subject eventually walks past. (And I have done that.) But the best balance, I’ve found, is to adjust to the conditions you're given and follow your nose.", "For example, rain might momentarily dampen my spirits. But when it passes, it will have provided colorful reflections and deeper blacks. (Not to mention, it will clear out tourists in scenic spots and offer me more open frames to work with.)", "Weather and light are largely out of our control. So as creatives working in external environments, we need to adapt and work with what we’re presented with.", ": Go with the flow. If the sunset fizzles out, don’t pack up your bags – look for textures and patterns in the rocks. If the river is flooded, look for abstract details in the flowing water or shift your attention to the surrounding trees and ferns. You might not get the shot you originally envisioned – you might get something better.", "Clean, noise-free images are overrated. I know that sounds like heresy on DPReview. (Please play nice in the comments section.) But it’s one of the most important lessons I’ve learned from street photography.", "Out on the street, moments pass you by, often disappearing as quickly as they arise. You might see a flicker of a smile in a dimly lit storefront. Or hear a classic car zipping down the street.", "To capture these fleeting frames, I often push my ISO to 2000 and beyond. In the rapid-fire nature of street photography, having a faster shutter speed is necessary to allow me to freeze moments before they disappear. I’ll regularly use smaller apertures too, limiting my light even more. I might default to around F5.6 – instead of the X100V’s possible F2 – to help ensure my moving subject falls within the greater depth of field.", ", I hear you say. ", "Fair point, but let’s consider two scenarios.", "Scenario A: You’re shooting a waterfall. It’s overcast, the light is soft and you’re happy with a one-second exposure for silky smooth water. But what about the foreground ferns swaying in the breeze? You’ll need a faster frame so they’re not blurry. You could try widening your aperture – but then you’ll run into depth of field issues, like trying to focus-stack moving objects. I’d rather bump my ISO to get the faster frame with my foliage in focus and avoid unnecessary hassles in post-processing.", "Scenario B: You’re shooting a seascape at dawn. The sky is exploding before sunrise and you’re able to get a clean, balanced exposure at two seconds. But to retain texture in the moving water, the shutter speed will need to be closer to a quarter second. So I’ll bump my ISO to 640 to get the faster frame, capturing the force and energy of the crashing waves.", ": Sometimes, you need to make compromises. A sharp image at a high ISO is better than a blurred one at ISO 100. Too often, the fear of noisy images becomes a bigger impediment to good images than the noise itself.", "I once believed the aim of landscape photography to be the pursuit of perfection. To capture the perfect sunrise. The perfect waterfall. Or the perfect wave.", "Street photography has truly shattered that false goal. Strolling down sidewalks, my eye would dart towards appealing features like colorful doors or historic buildings down cobbled lanes. But then I’d notice parked cars, rubbish bins or garish signs that detracted from the scene.", "At first I often wouldn’t take a shot, as I was stuck in the mindset that one imperfection ruined the entire photo. Yet over time, I decided to take the shot regardless, even if only as a reference frame to revisit later. As I did, I began to accept and work with these distractions.", "Perhaps I could blur out the bin with a wide aperture. Or take a few steps to reframe the shot without the car. Or obscure the sign behind a tree. Or darken the distractions and subdue harsh colors in Lightroom.", "Photography isn’t about perfection. It’s about using your creativity to overcome challenges as best you can.", ": The world around us – both natural and urban – is often messy and unscripted. So work with distractions when they arise. Try wider apertures to turn an unattractive foreground into an appealing blur. Or switch to a zoom lens to isolate your subject from competing elements.", "Cities can be chaotic working environments.", "Beyond the buzz of sensory inputs swirling around you, you also need to be aware of pedestrians, driveways and tripping hazards on the sidewalk. And that’s before you even start looking for and taking photos!", "So to help pay attention to the scenes unfolding around me, I’ve been treating street photography as a cellphone – and headphone – free zone.

My artistic journey has taken me to bustling cities as well as some of the most remote and inhospitable places on Earth.", "The work I create comes out of my ongoing journey of personal growth, especially to improve my mental health. Also fundamental to my work are global issues such as environmental change and the experience of isolation.", "In 2009 I was working with my therapist to explore how the idea of trees – which I was portraying a lot in my paintings at the time – represented my sense of loneliness. I had the sense that many of us feel like isolated trees in a forest full of people.", "Enter The Pink Bear. When encouraged to look for a positive memory, I recalled the carefree, tender feelings associated with a Polaroid print of Mum, Dad, myself and my brother when we were kids – with a giant 1980s neon pink bear mascot stoically settled among us. The memory of that photograph still brings a smile to my face and takes me to a place of love and safety. When I was uncomfortable in my own skin, I would go to the bear. The Pink Bear wasn’t hiding in a corner or running away from things, it was proud and strong.", "Each shot I make of The Pink Bear is choreographed with a real figure wearing a human-size character suit. Capturing my photographic works live, rather than faking the bear in a post-production edit, for me enhances the sense of nostalgia and romance. However, this commitment is also a physical challenge as I negotiate the practicalities of taking heavy equipment – the costume is 20kg (44 lbs) – on artistic missions that are frequently arduous if not flat-out dangerous.", "On my most recent trip I travelled across Mongolia for 10 days on horseback, through one of the world’s most remote and uninhabited landscapes, in order to create new photographic artworks of The Pink Bear. I had been planning this trip for three years, with the help of Megan Hine (whom I’m happy to now call a friend). Megan is a British survival expert who has led expeditions all over the world in some of the harshest environments – a real-life action hero. I was originally scheduled to go out to Mongolia in 2020, but the trip was postponed as the world locked down with COVID-19 restrictions. Disappointingly, the lockdown was still in force in 2021. Finally, at the start of 2022, we got the green light, and started the preparations for departure in September 2022.", "The nomadic life are slowly dying out in Mongolia, as younger generations are drawn to modern amenities and wealth in the main city of Ulaanbaatar. As the ancient traditions fade away and a life lived sustainably from the land is replaced by instant-gratification attitudes, it is more important than ever to shine a light on the traditional. A key focus of my artwork is the impact on the planet from over-consumption. The decision to make the whole trip on horseback, rather than in an off-road vehicle, was made in order to have a minimal carbon footprint and to celebrate tradition.", "To prepare for the trip I gave up alcohol and take-away meals for 3 months to get in top shape, and I had to begin taking horse-riding lessons because I’d never ridden in my life. It was an entirely new skill that was particularly challenging given a life-long fear of horses. It took me a while to get the hang of riding, especially with my camera gear on my back while trotting around the arena.", "No matter how tight I had my bag attached to me it would bounce up and down. In the riding school this was only a mild inconvenience. Unfortunately I discovered it's a very different story when on horseback for 8 hours a day and trotting up to 2 miles at a time in Mongolia. Sore would be an understatement – bruised and in pain is closer to reality.", "Making the expedition even more physically and mentally demanding were the extreme temperature changes each day. We experienced +25°C (77° F) sunshine, snowstorms and -15°C (5° F) nights. The outside of my sleeping bag would develop a thin skin of frost each day. When I needed the toilet in the middle of the night I had to be quick – it would take too long to put all my gear on so I just had to brave it. To have drinking water in the night I had to bring it in my sleeping bag or it would simply freeze inside the tent. For these sort of trips the right gear is fundamental or it would be impossible to survive in such harsh conditions, let alone create the artwork.", "Despite the hardship I found the landscape truly magical – bursting with color even though it was so empty and desolate. The rocky steppes were shades of green and orange as they leaked the copper and iron minerals that are contained within them, contrasting with shades of purple and blue as single clouds passed their shadows over the landscape. The ground at first glance looks barren and dead, but as I looked closer I could see networks of grass roots and tiny foliage ready to burst into flower.", "The horse I was riding would munch at the longer grass whenever it had the chance as we navigated the landscape, passing over mountains and hills, through valleys, and around lakes. No terrain was impossible for the impressively strong yet small horses. I was told you had to trust your horse to choose the path on such difficult ground rather than leading them. Further color was provided as we travelled by the changing weather and light – from white snowstorms under grey clouds, to glorious sunsets weaving highly saturated skies of endless hues. The whole journey felt like being on a purpose-built film set.", "I must admit that there were moments when I thought it would be so much easier travelling in a 4x4, but the bond I developed with the horse as we travelled through the vast and empty land wound up making the trip even more magical. I wanted to capture the precarious beauty of Mongolia, before global warming and westernization change the country irreparably. The eagle hunters with whom I was working may soon be relegated to legend, and their traditional ways of living and hunting in Mongolia may vanish too. I felt so lucky to be able to experience this way of living firsthand.", "Without doubt the highlight of the trip was the day we photographed The Pink Bear on horseback with the golden eagles in the isolated landscape of the Altai region. But then the day got even better as an impromptu party was thrown and we partied with the eagle hunters and locals well into the night under the stars, drinking local vodka and listening to Mongolian techno. It was the perfect ending to the day, and Mongolia won a permanent place in my heart.", "I am dedicated to liberating art from the confines of the traditional gallery space and bringing it to broader audiences. The adventures I go on with The Pink Bear do just that, and this Mongolian trip was no different. The Pink Bear brought smiles to locals and even inspired them to take their own photos of the bear outside their gers in the remote Mongolian landscape.", "Who knows?

Having directional control of light, powering the light down to give it just a kiss on the eyes and cheekbones, and positioning it where I needed far away from the hot shoe, opened up new creative freedoms and provided new decisions to make in how to approach every assignment.", "Light is a powerful storytelling tool. The difference between a good image and a great image often comes down to how light is used to create a mood, atmosphere, framing, direction, contrast, tension, juxtaposition and pretty much everything that goes into the craft.", "I leaned into the subtle changes, for instance, how using directional light allowed me to see my peers, other people of color, more accurately in images, with skin tones properly exposed and hints of catchlight to light up eyes.", "Today, there are many affordable wireless options, but if you're just learning, have a limited budget and want to experiment with light to better learn how it works and how to control it, the wired option is a perfect low-cost addition to your kit.", "Just take your cord in hand and start practicing.

I cranked my flash up to just a third of a stop above the sunlight, brought in my bounce cards and turned the shelter assignment into a weekly opportunity to practice. I gave those critters a glow, and I'm proud to say that every cat and dog I photographed was adopted in under 12 hours. Sometimes a paper would land on doorsteps at 6:00 am, and by 10:00 am, someone would have adopted the dog or cat I photographed that week.", "A set of PocketWizards and reflectors replaced the off-shoe cord by 2014 when I used some directional light to photograph Jane Goodall.", "I eventually started photographing people with more expensive and fancier lights, but I never forgot my trusty corded option. Thanks to a 2-foot cord (the Canon OC-E3), I had gone from someone who hated flash to someone who learned how a touch of fill and a catchlight changes everything.", "I was especially wrong to think that artificial light was 'impure.'

But they were fun. Today we efficiently build amazing buildings 160 stories high. But nobody puts gargoyles on them anymore. Nobody puts secret codes in the ceilings, either.", "The early days, back when photographic advances were made by individuals rather than corporations, are much more fun to write about. People do brilliant things and stupid things, are petty and magnanimous, are obsessive and distracted. The inventors of photography often despised each other, lived in countries that scorned each other, and fought like they were arguing about lens sharpness on a camera forum.", "Even 150 years later, national pride and a host of other factors color all but the most academic articles on the history of photography. Who am I kidding, they color the academic articles, too. The French claim to have invented photography and by strict definition they did.

At first, I spent ridiculous amounts of time deciding which version was true(st), often unsuccessfully. So, generally, when I can’t decide ‘what is most true’ I go with ‘which version is most amusing’.", "I also wander off topic when I find that amusing. Take it for what it’s worth. My path through history is similar to a drunken man’s walk home from the pub; it gets there, but it wanders around a bit.", "This first article is about the early developments leading up to the invention of the camera; the first efforts to make permanent images from light. So many people came so close that the camera really should have been invented long before it actually was. All the pieces where there, but no one put it all together.", "Today we can’t really grasp what a huge deal being able to make an image was in the 1800s. You could have a portrait painted, but that took up to a year to complete and on average cost over a year’s salary for a working man. Sketches were quicker and cheaper (although not that much) and you could buy printed engravings (they were still pretty expensive).", "For most people, even the wealthy, if you wanted an image of something, you needed at least some basic artistic skills to make it yourself.", "The camera obscura was a device that helped create images which was around for centuries before photography. We took the word ", " came from the ", " which literally means ", ". The first camera obscura consisted simply of a pinhole in the wall of a dark room or shed: an inverted image of the scene outside the room could then be seen on the wall opposite the pinhole.", "The use of the camera obscura was first described in China in the 5th Century BC when Mo Ti used it to trace images. Aristotle, Euclid, Alhazen (the father of optics), Kepler, Galileo and Da Vinci all used and wrote about camera obscuras.", "The camera obscura was widely used as a drawing aid by artists in the Renaissance. In the mid-1500s Giambattista della Porta suggested in his book “", "” that a camera obscura with a convex lens should be used to sketch all portraits and landscapes before painting.", "Over time, the camera obscura evolved into a wooden box with a lens and mirror that was somewhat portable.", "While the camera obscura remained in widespread use by artists, it wasn’t written about much until the 1700s. (Whether this was from fear of Sorcery charges, or simply artists not wanting to reveal the tools of their trade, is unclear. Probably a bit of both.)

The better ones contained focusable lenses, mirrors to flip the image upright, and ground glass screens on which the image was projected.", "Artists traced the projected images and painted it later if they wished, but this had to be done by hand. It was time consuming and required at least some artistic ability. The camera obscura, after centuries of steady improvement, was certainly ready to become the photography camera from at least the mid 1700s. A century later, the first cameras were basically camera obscuras with the light projected onto light-sensitive plates rather than ground glass screens. Only the means to capture the image was lacking. Well, actually it ", ", but nobody realized that yet.", "Unlike the camera obscura, the development of light sensitive plates and chemicals wasn’t a story of steady progress. It’s basically a story of forgotten technologies, stops and starts, and missing the obvious.", "People have known for a long time that certain chemicals, notably some salts of silver, would darken when exposed to light. An Italian physician and early chemist, Angelo Sala, published a pamphlet in 1614 that stated silver salts “turn as black as ink when exposed to the sun.” But Robert Boyle (of Boyle’s Gas Law fame, and therefore considered much more authoritative at the time) felt it was exposure to air or heat, not light, that caused the change. So, the silver salt thing got dropped completely for 100 years.", "It got reintroduced in a very roundabout way. In 1674 an alchemist (the guys trying to turn lead into gold) named Christoph Balduin was working with the liquid alchemists most liked to work with: Aqua Regia (literally meaning Royal Water). Aqua Regia isn’t really water, it’s a solution of Nitric and Hydrochloric acid. It got its name because, not surprisingly, it would dissolve any of the Royal metals: gold, silver, platinum, etc*. Alchemists thought since Royal Water could make gold disappear, maybe it could make other things turn into gold.", "Since you never know just what might turn into gold, Balduin decided to dissolve some chalk (Calcium Carbonate) in Aqua Regia. He got no gold, but created a substance (calcium nitrate, although he didn’t know that) that would glow in the dark for hours after it had been exposed to strong sunlight. In 1674 there were two known ways to get light: the sun and fire. So, a substance that glowed without giving off heat was a Major Big Deal. He demonstrated it to the Royal Society, which promptly made him a member, and published a paper about it which was widely read.", "Around 1717, a German physician named Johann Schulze decided he’d like to have some glow-in-the-dark material (who doesn’t) and repeated Balduin’s recipe. But his Aqua Regia had already been used to dissolve some silver and was contaminated with silver salts, so he actually created silver nitrate, rather than the calcium nitrate he intended. Rather than glowing in the dark, the silver nitrate became black when exposed to the sun. You know, like Angelo Sala had discovered 100 years before.", "Schulze was a better scientist than Balduin, figured out he’d made silver nitrate, and demonstrated the darkening effect was caused by light, not heat or air. He even made images by placing stencils over a bottle filled with silver nitrate solution and exposing it to light. The image remained until he shook the flask, erasing the image. Sort of the original Etch-a-Sketch.", "In a paper he published in 1727, Schulze even suggested that this chemical change could be combined with the camera obscura to create images. The images were temporary, though, since any time you looked at them you exposed the rest of the silver nitrate to more light, eventually turning it all black. Schulze’s work wasn’t exactly forgotten, but since all you could do with his silver nitrate was make temporary images, almost nobody did anything with it.", "The Swedish/German chemist and pharmacist Carl Scheele put the ‘almost’ in ‘almost nobody’. He discovered, around 1777, that silver chloride turned black with light exposure, just like silver nitrate. He also found that ammonia would dissolve unexposed, but not the exposed, black, silver chloride, washing it away. This presented the world with a way to “fix” silver chloride images. Scheele’s findings (all of them, not just this) were largely ignored or forgotten since he worked in Stockholm, rather than in one of the academic centers. It’s too bad, because had anyone read his papers, dozens of people wouldn’t have spent the next 60 years trying to find a way to “fix” images they were making with silver salts.", "Scheele, dubbed “the hard luck chemist” by Isaac Asimov, was also the first to discover oxygen, barium, chlorine, uric acid, glycerol, and hydrogen cyanide. His papers were not widely circulated until years after his death, by which time others, including Sir Humphrey Davy, had been credited for making the discoveries. He died young, which is not surprising after years of working with toxic chemicals, especially when you consider his work included descriptions of the smell of chlorine gas and what hydrogen cyanide tastes like.", "Anyway, by the 1770s, at the latest, all the requirements needed to create photographs were in place. Not that it mattered.", "Thomas Wedgwood", " was one the first to purposefully set out on the Holy Quest of making permanent images from light. Thomas was the fifth son of Josiah Wedgwood, founder of the Wedgwood Ceramic company. Josiah was quite the experimenter, created a number of new ceramics techniques including transfer printing (transferring glaze from an engraved plate, rather than hand painting) and made a massive fortune. Thomas, who was described as ‘sickly’ and ‘sensitive’ was never involved in the business now controlled by his older brothers. However, he had plenty of money and free time. He spent much of both associating with painters, sculptors, and poets (for whom he often acted as a patron), and visiting doctors for his ailments, for which he was often prescribed opium.", "Starting in 1790 or so, Wedgwood became obsessed with capturing images. While it is widely thought that Wedgwood was trying to develop new methods of making contact prints to be transferred to ceramics, this is probably not true. He had little association with the family business, and it is known he tried to make images using a camera obscura, not just contact prints.", "On one of his doctors visits, Wedgwood met Humphrey Davy who, way before he became a 'Sir', studied medicine. He enlisted Davy’s help in the chemistry of making images. Davy knew of Schulze’s findings using silver salts and he and Wedgwood spent several years producing images by contact printing on paper, ceramics, and leather. However, they obviously didn’t know about Scheele’s description of fixing silver salts using ammonia, and they were never able to fix the images permanently.", "They did publish “An Account of a Method of Copying Paintings upon Glass, and of Making Profiles, by the Agency of Light upon Nitrate of Silver. Invented by T. Wedgwood, Esq.” in the Journal of the Royal Institute in 1800. This was a minor journal and not widely read, but at least it documented their groundwork for future experimenters. It is known that David Brewster, a close friend of Henry Fox Talbott, knew of, and wrote about, Wedgwood’s paper", "Mr. Wedgwood was never a well man, suffering chronic headaches and stomach pain and taking significant amounts of opium. He died in 1805 at age 34. Perhaps his most significant contribution to the world was the annuity that he provided to fellow opium appreciator ", ", which allowed Coleridge to devote himself full-time to writing poetry. After Wedgwood’s death Davy lost interest in their experiments and moved on to other things.", "We’re only about 40 years away from the first camera being invented.

{"title": "The Beginning of Photography: The Drama of 1839", "content": ["The drama of ‘39", "On January 6, 1839, François Arago, Secretary of the French Academy of Sciences, announced Daguerre’s invention and spoke of his accomplishment publicly, although he said nothing of the specific methods involved.", "By the middle of January, news of Daguerre’s invention had spread everywhere. Today, when imaging is so common and taken for granted, it’s hard to imagine how amazing the idea of taking a picture was in 1839. It created immediate headlines around the world.", "The actual techniques used remained secret, however, since the French government had not yet officially bought the invention from Daguerre. The secrecy led to some suspicion that this was a trick or fake, and just like today, a few people 'proved' it was impossible. Most believed, though. This was an era when revolutionary new technology became available almost every year.", "The announcement of Daguerre’s achievement wasn’t published in England until January 19", " – the telegraph wasn’t in use yet so dispatches went by rail and boat.", "William Henry Fox Talbot, he of too many names and too many interests (he had set aside his development of photography to work on an archeology book), heard of Daguerre’s invention as soon as it hit the English papers. His reaction was immediate, arrogant, and overblown — which would characterize most of his reactions for the rest of his life. After reading of Daguerre’s camera, he wrote (in typical Talbot dramatic fashion) that he was “placed in an unusual dilemma, scarcely to be paralleled in the Annals of Science”.", "Talbot wanted both public credit and financial gain for his work on photography. Having no idea if Daguerre’s methods differed from his own, he immediately tried to establish precedence as the first inventor, filing patents for ‘making permanent images using a camera obscura’ (the only thing he knew Daguerre used). He rushed samples of his ‘photogenic drawings’ to the Royal Institute in London where they were exhibited on January 25th, only weeks after Daguerre’s announcement. He provided documentation that they had been taken as early as 1835, hoping that would make his images the earliest. (They weren’t).", "Then he wrote letters to Arago and other academic societies stating that he would file disputes regarding the priority of Daguerre and presented a paper with the catchy title of “", "”. Once he learned that Daguerre made positive images on silver plates, Talbot filed more patents: for images made on paper, for making negative images, and for printing positive images from negative images.", "Sir John Hershel, an acquaintance of Talbot’s and one of the premier scientists of the day, read of Daguerre’s achievements and then of Fox Talbot’s exhibition at the royal society in late January of 1839. With basically no other knowledge than ‘photographs had been’ made he wrote in his journal:", "Within a few days he had sensitized paper with silver salts and made images — in fact he was exhibiting his own photographs within weeks. He was aware that both Daguerre and Talbot could not permanently fix their images, which slowly deteriorated over time. He knew that hyposulphite of soda (sodium thiosulfate) dissolved silver salts, so he used this to fix his images permanently. Rather than take out patents, he notified Daguerre and Talbot of this, and they both adapted “hypo” (as it has since been known to photographers) as their fixative. It remained in use for over a century.", "Hershel also found Talbot’s terms ‘photogenic drawing’, ‘reversed copy’ and ‘re-reversed copy’ rather cumbersome and coined the terms ‘photography’, ‘negative’, and ‘positive’. Hershel also experimented with non-silver chemicals in an attempt to make the photographic process less expensive. He found he could create a similar light sensitive process using iron citrate and potassium ferricyanide which resulted in bright blue images: the ", ". The low cost of this process (and the fact that Hershel didn't patent) made it popular for photography for a while, especially for scientific images, like those botanist Anna Atkins made. Cyanotypes later became the engineering printer of the times; the blueprint.", "Trying to calm the furor over in England, Arago invited Hershel, Talbot, and other English scientists to come to Paris to view Daguerre’s work. Talbot was too busy filing patents and refining his technique, but Hershel went. Much to Talbot’s dismay, Hershel wrote publicly:", "Probably not realizing that Talbot was taking all this very personally, rather than scientifically, Hershel wrote directly to Talbot in a letter:", "There is no question Hershel’s description was accurate. The difference between a Daguerrotype (below) and Talbot’s images of the time (the image at the top of this article) is dramatic.", "Talbot, who initially required 30 minutes, at least, to expose an image, must have tossed his breakfast after reading Hershel’s letter. But Talbot was a stubborn man and just continued to insist his way was the right way. It was the right way, of course, but it would be a few years before that became apparent. Largely because of Talbot.", "At this point, May of 1839, Daguerre was still waiting for the French Government to actually pay for his invention. Arago wanted to make it “a gift to the world” but Daguerre wasn’t that altruistic. He didn't wait idly, however. He’d taken a rather broad interpretation of Argo’s definition of ", " and decided that meant ", ". Plus he was aware of Tablot’s actions so he quietly had an agent take out patents on his invention in England.", "Daguerre also arranged for his brother-in-law, Alphonse Giroux, to produce a wooden camera with lens supplied by Chevalier and a complete set of chemicals for his process. Each bore on its side a metal label “No apparatus is guaranteed unless it bears the signature of M. Daguerre and the seal of M. Giroux”. Giroux and Daguerre already were mass-producing these before the official announcement of his process and were selling them minutes after the announcement was made.", "On July 19th, the French Government finally passed a bill giving Daguerre a lifetime pension in return for his process (and a smaller pension for Isidore Niepce). On August 19th the details of the process were made public at a joint meeting of the French Academies of Science and Fine Arts. The event generated more excitement than a Talking Heads reunion tour: people arrived three hours early to find the hall already full and crowds lining the street. Within days every optician and chemist in Paris (and elsewhere for that matter) had sold out of lenses, silver nitrate, silver plates, and everything else needed to create photographs.", "The effects of the release were huge. Photographers were soon swarming over every bit of photogenic real estate in Paris, making image after image (real estate because the early Daguerrotypes required exposure times too long for portraits). Many were making artistic images, but just like today, others quickly became more enamored with their equipment’s resolution. A lament written at the time (which may be apocryphal) would be perfectly at home on a DPR forum today.", "Daguerre retired almost immediately to Bryn-Sur-Marne where he wrote a 79-page book on his process that was immediately translated into a dozen languages. He continued quiet experimentation in photography until his death in 1851.", "The exposure times shortened quickly as chemical processes were refined. Within a year Daguerrists, as they were called, had set up portrait studios in every major city of the world. Even smaller cities were visited by traveling Daguerrists. For the first time an image of a family member could be made easily and then kept forever.", "If you remember from the last article, two members of the “greatest names in photography” team, Antoine Hercules Florence and Hippolyte Bayard had also developed photographic techniques at this time. Hercules, a Frenchman living in Brazil, had only delayed and incomplete knowledge of the events in Paris. When he did become aware, though, he was the perfect gentleman stating only that his techniques were not nearly as advanced as those of Daguerre and making no claims for himself.", "Hippolyte Bayard had approached Arago in 1839, presenting his own techniques which created positive images, like Daguerrotypes, but used less expensive paper, like Talbot’s process. Arago feared Bayard’s claims would interfere with his plan to release the Daguerrotype process “as a gift to the world”, asked Bayard to remain quiet, and inferred that he, too, would get some form of government pension. This didn’t happen and Bayard ended up demonstrating his technique to the French Institute in exchange for enough money to buy some chemicals.", "Bayard, who loved him some drama, used his technique to create the first staged photograph: “Self Portrait As a Drowned Man” which he exhibited at the French Institute with the following caption:", "Hippolyte got his stuff together after a bit, though, and went on to have a most successful photographic career. Shooting Daguerreotypes.", "Back in England Talbot continued to work on his process, making a huge discovery: the principle of developing a latent image. He found that if he bathed his silver iodide papers in a solution of gallic acid and silver nitrate after a brief exposure, the latent image (invisible at first) would “develop” and become visible. He then “fixed” his negatives in hypo and printed positives as he always had. This both shortened exposure times and improved image quality significantly.", "It is this process, the Calotype, that became the forerunner of film photography. Calotype images were markedly improved over Talbot’s early work. They still didn’t provide the superb detail of a Daguerreotype, but they had one huge advantage: one could make multiple prints and create mass media.", "Talbot patented his invention in England, but charged such high patent fees (up to £800) that almost no one in England used the process. A group of opticians, chemists, and photographers began a long series of legal battles attempting to overturn Talbot’s patents. But the more they tried, the more stubborn he became, and the patent wars raged on for nearly a decade.", "However, Talbot, being quite the Anglophile, had patented his process in England and Wales, not bothering to patent it in Scotland and other countries. Daguerre, if you remember, had patented his invention in England, but not elsewhere.", "Largely for this reason, England lagged behind the rest of the world in photography for quite a while, while Scotland and France became centers of photography. Scottish photographers, for example, could use either the Calotype or the Daguerrotype processes without paying any royalties; photographers in England had to pay royalties for either process.", "A number of French photographers took advantage of the situation and began using Talbot's process. It probably didn’t help Talbot’s mood much that Frenchmen made two dramatic improvements to his technique. The first, waxing the paper used in the process, increased the photographic detail significantly. Édouard Baldus, Gustave Le Gray, Henri Le Secq, and Charles Nègre were printing superb images using this process in the 1840s. In France. But no one did in England.", "The second improvement, the albumen process, was developed by ", ", who published and made it freely available in 1847. This used albumen from egg whites to bind photographic chemicals to paper, creating a glossy surface and allowing thousands of positive prints to be made from a single negative. (Talbot’s technique allowed for, at most, a few hundred).", "With these advances, Calotypes became THE photographic method used by explorers, archeologists, and others publishing their photographs or documenting their travels in book form; they just didn’t print the books in England. As for Talbot himself, he made hundreds of Calotypes and published some of them in a series of booklets entitled “The Pencil of Nature”, which was the first published photography book. It came out as ‘fascicles’ of twenty-four plates each, but it was not a commercial success and was terminated after the first six fascicles were released.", "While Talbot was vigorously defending his English patents, another Englishman, Frederick Scott Archer, developed a new technique in 1848. The collodion (or wet plate) process, used glass coated with a gelatin to hold the silver chemicals. Archer did not patent, publishing his technique so that others could use it freely. The collodion (or wet plate) technique was relatively inexpensive, exposed quickly, and the glass plate negative was easier to print from.", "Talbot, being Talbot, sued wet-plate photographers on the grounds that this technique was just like his own. British photographers rallied to the case and brought reams of evidence that Talbot was not the true inventor (much of the evidence was later found to be false and fabricated). The jury found that Talbot’s patents were valid, but only for his exact process. Anyone who varied from his published methods even slightly was not guilty of patent violation, and by that time all photography varied from Talbott's original methods.", "Talbot had finally lost the war, and England had finally joined the rest of the photography world. Archer’s wet plate technique itself advanced photography greatly, but the fact that it led to the breaking of Talbot’s patents particularly advanced the art in England.", "Frederick Scott Archer, unfortunately, benefitted not at all and died penniless in 1857. After his death, Punch magazine asked for donations for the family:", "About £767 were raised for Archer’s family; a fair amount of money at the time. About as much as Talbot charged for one license to use the Calotype process.", "The collodion process wasn’t perfect. Collodion (nitrocellulose), which is made from gun cotton dissolved in ether and alcohol, has an annoying tendency to explode, for one thing. Preparation of the plates and photographic technique using them was difficult. But the images obtained were better than Calotypes and created negatives that could print thousands of copies, unlike Daguerrotypes.", "Direct positive images would continue to be made, not only Daguerrotypes, but less expensive Tintypes and Other types. Because of their fine detail, positives were a favorite for portraits for quite a while. But the negative-image-to-positive print process would become the standard for most photographic work.", "So, who was the real Father of Photography? It would make a good paternity suit. Niepce created the first permanent images using a camera. Daguerre perfected the technique that allowed it to become mainstream (and was the only one to benefit financially). Talbot’s different technique allowed multiple copies of images to be mass produced, and the negative-image to positive-print is the basis for all photography from the 1800s until digital.", "But, I think no matter who you credit with fathering photography, Frederick Scott Archer, who freed photography so that anyone of reasonable means could afford to take photographs and whose discoveries led directly to the development of film, is the one who raised the child."], "url": "https://www.dpreview.com/opinion/5110795766/the-beginning-of-photography-the-drama-of-1839"},

When looking at music, for example, I'd claim that in addition to writing new compositions, there surely exists such a thing as performance art, whereas in photography it does not exist.

I like to look at the different aspects of an image to give an assessment regarding how original it is.

These locations still hold original compositions, but it requires a lot of work to find them.

Even if you love the shots you see from there, chances are you'll have a hard time coming up with your own thing after thousands of people studied every square centimeter of the place, and it's very probable that even if you find a new composition, it will look very similar to other people's.

The company plans to introduce Ilford Multigrade V RC Deluxe as stocks of the current version sell out, and Ilford Ortho Plus should go on sale at the end of November.", "The new paper is said to offer deeper blacks and ‘improved’ spacing between the mid-tones, along with a slightly warmer base tint in the paper. Ilford says too that contrast is more consistent across the tonal range which will make printing more predictable.", "Ilford has made an orthochromatic emulsion for some time, but it has only been available on sheet formats in the recent past. Cut sheets of 5x4in have been the smallest widely available size, so introducing it for 35mm and 120 medium format cameras will make the film accessible to a much wider audience. Ilford Ortho Plus is designed for copy work, but its color sensitivity also makes it suited to creative uses. Rated at ISO 80 in natural light and ISO 40 in tungsten conditions, the film is only sensitive to green and blue light, and thus darkens anything red in the scene.", "It emphases blood stains in forensic work, but can also create interesting effects in portraiture as it darkens freckles and brings out skin texture. The film is very fine-grained and can produce punchy contrast and high resolution in flat copy work. Sensitivity drops off at around 570nm, so it can be processed ‘by eye’ under red safe-light conditions without the risk of fogging. It is suitable for processing with all of Ilford’s main-stream chemicals.", "The company has also created a new film processor’s starter kit that includes a Paterson dev tank, two spirals, film clips, measuring cylinders, thermometer and pre-measured chemicals to fit the tank.", "For more information see the ", ".", "Press release", "NEW PRODUCTS ANNOUNCED PRODUCTS INCLUDING 5TH GENERATION ILFORD MULTIGRADE RC PAPER & ILFORD ORTHO FILM IN 135 AND 120 FORMATS", "ILFORD announced the world’s first variable contrast MULTIGRADE paper in 1940 and in 2019, as we celebrate our 140", " anniversary, we are pleased to announce the 5", " generation of our best-selling MULTIGRADE RC Papers.", "MULTIGRADE IV RC papers (4", " generation) were launched 25 years ago and have been hugely successful becoming the ‘go to’ black & white RC papers for discerning students, amateurs and professional darkroom users all over the world.", "“Improving them was not going to be easy but we wanted to bring the manufacturing in line with the latest emulsion making technology used in our other RC and fibre papers and so we have redesigned the emulsion from the ground up.

We know photographers want choice and love to try new films and so we have now coated our Ortho emulsion onto an acetate base for 35mm cassettes and 120 rolls. We believe ORTHO PLUS offers superb photographic potential thanks to its fine grain and sharpness and some of the results we have seen are stunning.” Giles Branthwaite, Sales & Marketing Director.", "The blue and green sensitivity of this emulsion enables the film to be handled in deep red safelight conditions making processing and inspection easier. Its lack of red sensitivity also means that reds and oranges are rendered darker than panchromatic films.", "Building on the launch of the ILFORD Simplicity range of film processing chemicals in 2018, we have worked in collaboration with Paterson, a specialist manufacturer of some of the world’s most popular darkroom products, to create a starter kit containing all you need to process your first two rolls of film.

{"title": "Landscape photography with a drone: disadvantages and limitations part 2", "content": ["In the previous article I wrote about the basic disadvantages and limitation of the drone: it depends on batteries, has limited range, flight altitude and speed, all of which put it at a disadvantage compared to shooting from a manned aircraft. Granted, the drone is a very different tool to a manned aircraft, but I compare the two to emphasize that the photographer should be aware of the advantages and limitations of each option when planning a shoot.", "This time, I would like to discuss another disadvantage of the drone: it's VERY easy to lose.", "To a drone user, crashes are a part of life. Drones keep getting better and safer, they are fit with sensors to avoid collisions, programmed to fly back to the home point when connection has been lost with the remote, but they are still not completely safe from tumbling down from the sky, and they still get lost quite often. Iceland's Glacier Lagoon and Greenland's Disko Bay must be a few meters shallower with all the Phantoms and Mavics that have been drowned there over the last decade. A colleague of mine's clients lost 2-3 Mavics in one photo workshop in Disko Bay! Wow, just wow.", "But why is that? How come drones just keep falling from the sky or become lost, never to be found again? If you disregard animal attack and hostile interception (both very rare events), there could only be two main reasons: human error and technical malfunction. Sometimes it can be both factors working together.", "Earlier in this series I referred to drones as being 'idiot proof.' That was probably overstating it. Drones are by no means idiot proof, or even not-so-idiot proof. A better term would be 'idiot resistant,' as a drone can only correct its user's mistakes so much – it is, after all, just a machine.", "One of my workshop clients once lost a drone when we were shooting next to a lake. The problem was that the lake was a natural wind-tunnel, and a temporary stillness encouraged us to take the drones up. Upon feeling the wind getting stronger I brought my drone down and alerted my client to do the same. He chose to keep on flying, and once the wind grew even fiercer, he quickly lost orientation. A few minutes later the drone crashed down, while still keeping in contact with the remote.", "DJI's remotes have a distance indicator, showing how far the drone is from the home point, and we could see that the drone wasn't too far away. My client started walking in the direction that kept reducing the distance, but eventually understood that the drone was resting on a mountain on the other side of the lake. It's probably still there.", "There is a lesson to be learned here. First of all, once you feel the winds getting dangerously strong, there's no shame in bringing a drone back down. Secondly, if you lose orientation, don't let the drone just drift with the wind. Instead, try your best to fly it back toward the home point. A lower flight altitude usually means gentler winds, so in case the drone isn't progressing home, try flying lower.", "Another very common avoidable mistake is stretching the battery for too long. A drone's remote will start protesting when battery level is below some (adjustable) figure. The default for DJI drones is 30%, but this depends on the drone's distance to the home point. When the battery drops further, the drone will usually alert the user that it will automatically go home in a few seconds. This too can be overridden by the user, in case he or she wants to keep controlling the drone and shoot some more.", "Lastly, when the drone is at 10% battery or less, it will automatically and autonomically start landing. But even this can be avoided if the user actively uses the joysticks to keep the drone airborne.", "An experienced drone user can sense when they need to bring the drone back. In perfect conditions, without wind, when flying low and close to the operator, there is no real reason to bring the drone back home at 30%, 20% or even 15% battery. If you can bring the drone back in a matter of seconds, by all means, keep flying until you reach 10% and then land it. But when conditions get harder, that's when experience is critical and you have to keep a close eye on the battery status.", "Depending on distance, altitude and (mainly) wind conditions, the amount of battery power needed to bring the drone back may increase significantly. Yours truly has almost lost a drone when wind picked up significantly during an afternoon shoot in a pumice-stone field in the high altitude desert of Argentina. I struggled to fly the drone, which was facing harsh head-winds, and by the time I managed to land, I was on 1% battery (!).", "It's easy to be caught up shooting this beautiful Pumice-stone field, but the place is huge and the photographer must account for the drone's distance and sudden increases in wind forces, or they're risking the battery emptying before being able to bring the drone back to the launch point.", "DJI Mavic II Pro, 1/25 sec, f/5.6, ISO 100. Puna de Argentina", "I will conclude the discussion of human error-related crashes with a story from my recent Greenland photo workshop. My group was slowly sailing in an iceberg-packed part of Disko Bay. Since we were going to stay in that area for a while, I took out my drone and started shooting aerials of the icebergs.", "When the battery was about to run out, I decided it was time to bring the drone back home. But then I realized that the captain had moved the boat several hundred meters, so the home point indicator was useless.", "Moreover, the fact that the boat was sailing between thousands of iceberg – and it was a white boat – made finding it close to impossible. I had no indication of where the boat was or how to get to it. Using the larger icebergs as reference points was also futile, as the distances are huge and I couldn't judge their location relative to the boat when looking at the remote's screen.", "I was getting nervous. Minutes passed and battery power was continuing to dwindle. For the life of me, I simply could not find the boat. The remote started screaming when battery level reached 10%, and when it hit 5% I knew I had to do something, or lose the drone.", "I started to drop the drone's altitude, desperately looking for any possible landing site. At this point I was about 80% sure I would lose the drone. But then, I saw a large, relatively flat iceberg. I decided to land on the iceberg, without knowing if I was going to be able to retrieve the drone from it, even if the landing went well. After landing, the situation was looking grim. I was in a huge bay, with literally thousands of icebergs, one of which had my tiny drone on it. There was no way in hell I would find the drone without help.", "But then our captain's assistant, who had been though a similar situation, suggested that I use the \"find my drone\" feature on the DJI app. I had never used this feature, since I always knew how to get to the home point. But in this case, the home point was no longer where the boat was. I used the feature to see the drone's last GPS location, asked the captain to sail there, and what do you know – my drone was peacefully resting on the iceberg. Luckily, the iceberg was big enough for me to hop onto it from the boat, get the drone and return safely. It was quite a surreal experience.", "In retrospect, I could've done things differently and avoided the iceberg landing. I subsequently learned that it's possible to change the home point on the fly in the DJI app, so the return to home feature directs the drone to the current location of the remote. Live and learn! At least I have a good story, and by sheer luck, no harm was done and my drone lived to fly another day.", "Drones, as mentioned, are machines. And as machines, they can sometimes fail or operate in unexpected ways. The difference between a drone malfunction and a DSLR malfunction, however, is that when the former happens, the drone might not be seen or heard from ever again.", "There can be different reasons for a drone malfunctioning. In the past, DJI drones crashes numbered in the thousands due to people flying them when batteries were too cold. This has happened to me too, in Iceland – an event on which I'll elaborate at a later stage. Due to public outcry, DJI has had to include a better temperature warning system in its newer products.", "Greenland's famous Disko Bay is particularly notorious for drowning drones aplenty. This is mainly due to the large amount of iron in the bedrock, leading the drone's navigational systems to go haywire. Personally, I've never lost a drone in Greenland, but I've had my fair share of GPS malfunctions. When GPS fails, the drone starts drifting away with the slightest breeze, which, in extreme cases, can lead to a crash into the water.", "It's hard to resist the allure of flying a drone between the ice giants of Disko Bay. Be be wary of GPS malfunctions - they can cost you your drone.", "Again, the important thing is keeping cool, regaining orientation and preventing the drone from being swept too far away. The GPS system usually comes back up in a short while.", "Drones are constantly getting better and more fail-proof. They don't crash nearly as much as the used to, which is a very good thing.

If you have to move the camera to review a photo on the back screen, the subject gets out of your sight and finding it and focusing again is time consuming.", "I exclusively used the Sony FE 90mm F2.8G macro lens, sometimes with a 12.5 diopter wet lens attached in front of the lens port for shooting critters that are smaller (and some are much smaller!) than a centimeter. Each photo provided here includes the main exposure parameters in the caption, and the use of the diopter is noted as well.", "The Nauticam housing I used holds two powerful strobes. Below the surface, most of the sunlight is absorbed by the first few meters of water. At depths of 5 meters and more, all critters look almost colorless and it is the light of the strobes that brings back the colors. Even the light of the most powerful strobe is absorbed by the water and therefore underwater the distance from the camera to the (main) subject is usually less than 1.5 meters. Macro photography distance is less than 50 centimeters and super macro (magnification ratio above 1 – the recorded image size on the sensor is larger than the actual size of the subject) distances can be as close as 2 centimeters.", "For our diving sessions we were usually three photographers to a boat, accompanied by a local dive master who knows the waters very well and finds the critters for us. We were also accompanied by two boat drivers to handle the boat and help with the diving and photo gear and getting in and out of the water.", "The diversity of the creatures in this area is reach and unique.

Still, these numbers are very, very low and they are dependent on conservation efforts to survive.", "To avoid too much human contact, the Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA) allows people to be with the gorillas for no more than one hour a day. That hour comes at a cost of hundreds of dollars. Multiply that by the number of shoots you want to conduct, and you get the cost for the permits. Not cheap at all, and keep in mind that hotels, food and a car with a driver have to be added to the cost, not to mention (well-deserved) tips for the gorilla tracking crew.", "Every morning, after a drive to the park, we met our porters, handed them our photo bags, and walked for a few minutes to reach the ranger's hut.

On one hand, my composition skills have been well trained by shooting landscapes. On the other hand, landscape doesn't move that much or face away, and wildlife shoots are much more dynamic. I made peace with the possibility that some of the precious time with the gorillas would be partially wasted on regaining my wildlife shooting instincts. I knew I had to try to learn on the fly as well as I could, and most importantly, be very focused on the mission and make the best out of my time among the gorillas.", "The gorillas are much more incredible in real life than can ever be shown with an image. The sheer size of the silverback males is astounding – they weigh in at over 200kg, without a gram of fat on them. Their heads are as big as watermelons, and their hands are huge. To maintain that bulk, they have to eat about 35kg of vegetation every single day.", "The toddlers and juveniles love fooling around, dangling from branches and making funny faces. You are not allowed to approach the gorillas too closely, but that doesn't mean a curious youngling can't take interest and inspect the strange creature with the shiny thing!", "The very dynamic and playful nature of the toddlers often made the situation very chaotic.

This was the biggest challenge, and I feel I didn't perform perfectly in this aspect. Still, I got a few lucky shots.", "The conditions were not easy. A thick cloud cover offered beautiful soft light, but also made it quite dark, with the thick vegetation not helping. To add to this, the gorillas often stay beneath trees.

For me, having full manual control and reliable nighttime autofocus, those are the most important things. The Z7’s autofocus at night was just inferior to the D850’s when I was really pushing it. I’m usually shooting in pretty low light in the fires, and even with the 35mm F1.8, the Z7 would just be hunting, where the D850 was locking straight on. At night, in an action-filled, more photojournalism situation versus landscape or more everyday photography, I just couldn’t rely on the autofocus.", "When I say photojournalism kind of work I mean working in a face-paced environment where things are moving really quickly and I’m having to change settings constantly. Maybe I’m shooting people evacuating, or firefighters working, and then a few minutes later the camera is on a tripod to shoot some of the long exposure more fine art-type images. I found the Z7 harder to switch around between those shooting situations, but partly that might be on me - maybe I need to spend more time setting up the custom functions and modes.", "Autofocus was the real kicker though. I walked into some situations where I was photographing some property that was burned, to send in - I was on assignment at that time - and the D850 and 24-70mm were doing great, but the Z7 was just hunting for focus.", "Well, the first wildfire I ever photographed was when I was interning for the Orange County register. They have fire gear so I was able to borrow the proper safety gear right off the bat. But looking back, I didn’t know enough then about fire behavior to properly, safely cover it. If I were to do it all over again I would have gone with another photographer or reporter with more experience.", "The second fire I ever went to, I made a couple of mistakes that I was very lucky not to get hurt from. At that time I had the safety gear, but I didn’t have the experience. And that’s the biggest thing - understanding the weather, and understanding how fire behaves. And if you’re not paying attention to that you can very easily get hurt.", "My recommendation is that you shouldn’t just go out on a whim and photograph wildfires. It’s dangerous. You need to be doing it for a legitimate publication, something in the public interest. Any time I’m in a fire, I’m always sending images back. It’s important to me to do that. The reason we have media access to the fires in California is that the media serves a purpose, to inform the public.", "Even if you have accreditation you have an obligation to be safe, you have an obligation to wear the safety gear and have training and knowledge about wildfires because if you don’t, you could end up becoming the story. And at the end of the day I don’t think that’s a responsible thing to do.", "At this most recent fire, because it was in Los Angeles, there were a lot of people there. And especially on the first two nights when things were going really crazy, they had no protective equipment, they were parking in the road… and in my professional opinion they were safety hazards to themselves and the people around them. And for me, that’s frustrating.", "I see people that are really just kids, out there in shorts and T-shirts, and it’s incredibly dangerous. People don’t realize that the margins for error in fires that are driven by strong offshore winds are very low. If you’re in the wrong place at the wrong time, even if it’s just by a factor of a couple of seconds, that can be the difference between you going home safely or ending up in the burn unit.", "At the height of the Woolsey fire I was there being showered by embers, but I was wearing fire boots, a brush shirt, a brush jacket, then a helmet with a shroud that covered my face and neck, plus goggles and a passive respirator. I had to invest thousands of dollars in all of that safety equipment, and also invest a lot of time to understand fire behavior.", "My recommendation, if you’re a photographer interested in taking pictures at wildfires is firstly, shoot for an organization, so there’s a reason and a purpose for you being there. Secondly, you might need to do a ride along with someone more experienced before you start doing it for yourself. With fires getting worse on the west coast, I’m all for there being more people out there telling this story. It’s important that we have a diversity of voices, but there’s a proper way of doing it.", "Along with the reportage work, I’m also shooting images for my project. And that's what I mean when I say that Terra Flamma combines the art with the documentary work.", "The fire world is very small, although actually at this most recent fire I only saw one firefighter I knew. But when I’m photographing in the forest, with the Forest Service, there are people who are familiar with my work and know who I am, and they’re able to relax a little bit because they know I know what I’m doing. They don’t need to keep an eye on me, so they can focus on their work, which allows me to get closer and focus on the moments a little more.", "Part of the professional responsibility of covering these fires is investing in your own equipment and safety training. You can’t just go in like John Wayne and just start shooting. My first rule is be safe, don't compromise the safety of first responders, and stay out of their way. Once I feel like I'm covered there, it’s OK to start taking pictures.", "Well, there’s usually never a clear line. But for example if there’s a very narrow road in a fire zone with one way up and one way out, I won’t drive my truck up there. I’ll park and go on foot, or go to a different place. Because if I’m blocking an escape route for a fire engine, or compromising access for a fire crew, I don’t want to get in their way. The couple of seconds it would take for me to back up or do a u-turn, that could make the difference between getting out of the fire, and not.", "This most recent fire was moving so quickly that in a lot of places they barely had time to evacuate people. There were a lot of civilians just staying and not evacuating their houses, and I was saying ‘Look, guys, you seriously have a chance of getting killed if you stay here’. Some of them left, and for me that was the line - as soon as the firefighters left, so did I. There were some incredible pictures to be made, but the situation wasn’t safe. About five minutes later that whole area literally exploded into flames.", "Every situation, every fire, every day is different. You make a judgement call. There’s a fundamental way of being safe. I make sure I know what the weather is doing, I have escape routes worked out where I can go if things go bad. I'm taking pictures but I'm also keeping an eye out and looking around, and making sure a power line isn’t going to fall on me or something like that. That’s the base level of safety, and in each situation I assess it, and see where I can go and what I can do that will be safe, and won’t create a hazard for other people. It’s a lot of little learning experiences like that, which add up.", "One of the reasons I didn’t cover the Camp Fire is there were so many downed power lines and trees falling that I personally didn’t feel it was safe to go up there and drive around in certain areas. It’s a very hazardous situation up there. This past week, and the last year have been incredibly dangerous for numerous reasons. I also wanted to focus on the Woolsey Fire in Los Angeles, since it’s my home area, and report on the story happening locally. There are photographers doing important and powerful work at the Camp Fire in their own backyard.", "I think that in the beginning, especially the second fire I went to in 2013, the Powerhouse fire, I definitely did that. I got too far away from my car, I was about 1/4 mile away and the fire jumped the road between me and the car. I had to run down the road through the smoke, very close to the fire to get back to my car, hoping it hadn’t been burned up. I was wearing boots that didn’t fit me, so I tripped and twisted my ankle, then almost got run over by a fire truck. It was at that point that I thought ‘Alright, I need to get the training to learn how to not be a safety hazard’.", "Friday morning [November 9th] I drove in at about 8 or 9am when the Woolsey fire started running into Malibu. I was up on a hill, very close to Broad Beach, which is ’billionaire’s beach’ in Malibu where all the wealthy and famous live. The fire was coming up the canyon very rapidly, and I assessed that I maybe had five minutes to photograph there.", "One of the things I did on my way up was to look out for an escape route. I decided that the beach would be my escape route, and eventually the wind was pushing the fire all the way down the canyon, and in fact I did end up on the beach. The fire destroyed the neighborhood I’d been in five minutes previously. That was a situation where I knew this was a historic event, and I knew that I’d need to push to the limits of what was safe in order to tell the story. I stayed as long as the firefighters did, and when they left, I left.", "Probably the closest calls I’ve had have actually been driving back after fires, when I’m really tired and almost falling asleep at the wheel and driving off the freeway. And driving in the smoky woods, late at night, if something happens nobody will find you until the next day. These days I stop and take naps at off-ramps if I feel the fatigue coming on.", "Fire is a powerful force, and I feel that fundamental irony every time I’m in the field at a fire making pictures. On one hand, you have this incredible force of nature, which is exacerbated by humans, which can be both beautiful, terrifying, and awe-inspiring all at once. But it can also devastate, destroy neighborhoods, take dozens of lives, cut down hopes, dreams, and memories of families in houses and wilderness areas. The dichotomy there isn't lost on me and it weighs on my mind. Especially in California where the cost of owning a home is so high, losing your house can often mean financial ruin. It’s absolute tragedy and loss.", "But just because an image has tension in it, or there are extremely heavy subjects in an image or project, doesn't mean we should run away from facing difficult and inconvenient truths. I’d rather face the subject of wildfires, climate change, and the ensuing fallout head on, and if there are some pictures as the result of it that engage people to educate themselves about wildfire and make their own decisions on a changing climate, then the project is attaining its goal.", "Additionally, I am involved with a fire foundation [", "] that raises money for injured wild land firefighters and families of the fallen, and the wildfire community has become very close to my heart.", "Right. I’m doing this because wildfires are a function of climate change, and right now California and the western United States are taking the brunt of it. It’s important to me to document that and tell that story.", "The wildfires are getting larger, more destructive and killing more people in California. In 2017 we had the largest, most destructive and most deadly wildfires in California, and already in 2018, those fires have been eclipsed. The Camp fire is now the most deadly and destructive wildfire in California history, eclipsing the Thomas fire, which only happened a year ago, which was the ", " wildfire in California history until the Ranch fire in 2018. So already 5 out of the 10 most serious wildfires in California history have been in the last four years, and we’ve been keeping record since the 1890s. There is a direct correlation between that, and manmade carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere.", "Our weather patterns are changing. So normally at this time of year we get rain in California. But as the rainy season gets condensed, we get more extreme rain events. Instead of it raining in a 3-week period we might get all of our rain in 10 days, which causes flooding and allows the stored fuel to dry out more, which drives more aggressive fire behavior.", "Additionally, in a warming climate we have more days per year that support large fire growth. We have hotter days in the summer that are drying up the vegetation more quickly, which makes them more susceptible to burning. That’s measured using something called the ", ". They measured the area around the Camp Fire in Northern California and the Burn Index was 241. It was one of the highest burn indexes ever recorded.", "Well, if we’re going to talk about ", " - and I think it’s generous calling him that - ", " what he’s talking about. Most of the forests in California are managed by the federal government. So when he’s talking about cutting off money to the state of California, it doesn’t even make sense, fundamentally.", "Forest management is only part of the issue. Like most things, the answer is actually very complex. California includes a lot of very different climates, and every one needs to be managed differently. The way we manage forests by suppressing fires has in many cases increased the fuel load in forests. But the other thing is that we’re building houses on the Wildland Urban Interface, where the forest and scrub meets civilization. Malibu is a prime example of homes that are built on hillsides, and in areas that are covered in brush.", "We’ve built millions of areas in these interfaces and in transition zones. What that means is that the statistical likelihood of people’s houses being affected and of people being hurt in fires goes up. The fire triangle is heat, oxygen and fuel. So with climate change, you get drier fuels, less rain and hotter days, which are all the conditions needed to create fire growth.", "We need to have a conversation about where and how be build. Some areas are prone to regular intervals of wildfire, and we are not invincible against nature. The same fires happen in the same places, and as long as homes are rebuilt in certain areas, there will be a risk of destruction down the line. History repeats itself.", "Generally speaking, what we’re seeing is an acute effect of climate change. Some of the firefighters I speak to who have been climate change skeptics, and really quite conservative have said to me, ‘Stuart, I don’t know what’s going on, but things are different. I haven’t seen fires like this.’ They’ve said ‘For the longest time I thought climate change was B.S. but I can’t deny what I’m seeing in front of my eyes’. Climate change has become very politicized in the US, and I wish it weren't a Republican versus Democrat thing. I view it as a fundamental issue about the survival of people on this planet.", "The data is there. We see it happening, but unfortunately the political leadership, even when they acknowledge it, aren’t acknowledging the reasons why it’s happening. And it’s getting to the point where I’ve gone from thinking that I want to document what’s going on to being frankly terrified that after only six years working on this project I’ve seen the changes starting to accelerate."], "url": "https://www.dpreview.com/interviews/8563164917/wildfire-photographer-stuart-palley-on-the-new-abnormal"},

The secret to the eventual, inevitable, triumph over film were those most compelling of all disruptive drivers of change: convenience and immediacy.", "No matter that back in the late 1990’s the pioneering digital photographer had to lay out thousands of dollars on a camera, a computer, a (color) monitor and the seemingly endless cables, cards and connectors needed to make it all work (and, it must be said, the time, expertise and patience required to tame all that technology).", "We didn’t care that you could go get yourself a coffee between shots thanks to the painfully slow write speeds, or that we’d be lucky to get 20 minutes of shooting from a set of batteries or that transferring the images via serial cable took longer than the average Super Bowl, or that for the most part the end results looked like a VHS tape on pause and had the resolution of a watercolor painting.", "We early adopters didn’t care about any of that, because the magic of taking a picture and seeing it appear (almost) immediately on the rear screen, and the freedom to shoot to our heart's content without having to pay for film or processing (and without the need to scan images) was the most exciting thing to happen to photography since the Box Brownie.", "And given that most early adopters of digital cameras were also early adopters of the home computer, our pain tolerance was higher to begin with. After all, we were used to spending hours fixing SCSI conflicts and trying to get onto bulletin boards using our screeching, temperamental modems.", "For me, as a Mac user in the 1990’s, the biggest pain point by far was the supposedly simple process of getting the images off the camera and onto my hard drive, thanks to the lack of removal media (and the lack of card readers where there was removable media) and the horribly slow and Mac-unfriendly serial transfer process most cameras used for transfer.", "And then, in late 1997, along comes Sony with the first Mavica digital stills cameras, the FD5 and FD7 (which added a rare 10x zoom), offering sophisticated feature sets and – critically – storage on the ubiquitous and universally available 3.5” floppy disk.", "It may seem painfully archaic today, but back in 1996 when I first started seriously reviewing digital cameras I used to dream of a camera that shot directly onto floppies, which could be picked up for under a dollar each at any office supplier, and – critically – could be read without any additional equipment by almost every home and office PC on the planet.", "The first DSC Mavicas sold incredibly well for this reason alone (and they continued to be used by schools and government agencies for years after they were discontinued). It didn’t matter that the results from the 320 x 240-pixel interlaced CCD looked like video stills or that the fixed-power flash was only usable if your subject was half a mile away (otherwise everything got washed out) or that it was agonizingly slow – it was immeasurably more convenient and made sharing (in a pre-internet era) as easy as handing over a floppy disk.", "Showing the wisdom of never buying version one of anything, it was only six months or so after the FD5 and FD7 were released that Sony launched replacements, in the shape of the FD51 and (yes, I finally got round to the subject of this week’s TBT) the 10x zoom FD71.", "The FD71 brought a wealth of enhancements and fixes over its predecessor, including a faster floppy drive, faster processing, a new ‘true VGA’ progressive scan 640 x 480-pixel sensor, an improved LCD, a disk copy mode (making sharing even easier) and a new slimmer design. Even by 1998 standards though, it was still a monster, weighing in at around 1.3 lbs (590g) and roughly sharing the size and ergonomics of a full size hard disk drive.", "Multi mode - 9 QVGA frames in 2.5 seconds. Great for catching the action (or in this case, inaction).", "The FD71’s innovative feature set didn’t just solve the annoyance of slow serial transfer, it also sported a huge (for the time) 2.5” LCD screen (you could disable the back light and use reflectance to illuminate the image, meaning it could be – more or less – used in bright sunlight) and an InfoLithium battery that was capable of keeping the camera – and the power-hungry floppy drive inside – going for up to 2.5 hours or 2000 shots. (Sony even offered three different 'strengths' of battery.)", "The FD71 also boasted a 10x zoom (this was at a time when a 3x zoom was still a big selling point), fast autofocus, a vari-power flash, full photographic controls and a selection of in-camera special effects including a ‘multi’ mode that captured 9 small images in about 2.5 seconds and combined them into a single collage. It’s hard to imagine today, but almost all of these features were unheard of on consumer level digital cameras.", "All of this, including the fact that - despite having to save its images to a floppy disk - the FD71 was actually faster and more responsive than many of its competitors, made the FD71 a lot of fun to use, and despite the low resolution (most competitors were moving to 1 or 1.3 megapixels) it was a huge hit and a firm favorite in my office at the time.", "Writing about the FD71 I said “I may not have much use for the small images, and I sure can’t fit it in my pocket, but… the FD71 is the most enjoyable digital camera I have ever used, and proves Sony can still teach the traditional camera manufacturers.\"", "A few more pictures for your, ahem, pleasure..."], "url": "https://www.dpreview.com/articles/2701323663/sonys-mavica-fd71-likes-floppy-disks-hates-magnets"},

However, when I looked at where the moon would enter the frame on Photographers Ephemeris I saw that almost none of them would be in my composition.", "I knew I had to battle against the rising tide and might face issues with camera shake, especially with my 36MP Nikon D800, so I utilized my heaviest tripod: a 3.4kg Slik 780 DX Pro. If burrowed in the sand a little, it's almost completely resistant against the incoming surge as long as it's not much more than knee high.", "Composition-wise I went for a classic, dynamic two thirds setup with the waves' receding flow drawing the viewer's gaze into the image, right past the sea stacks out onto the ocean and the moon looming overhead in the left third of the frame. I tried to leave at least a little bit of separation between the rocks as their dark surfaces can be heavy and distracting if clumped up, drawing too much of the viewer's attention to a single area.", "It took me some time to get an incoming wave to create those leading lines I had imagined. Sadly, the image ended up being a bit too dark, so I would need to brighten the exposure a little in post processing and work on the contrast. To blame was the fact that dawn had already kicked in and I had to readjust my camera settings each minute, and at that moment I tried adding a ND filter. When an especially promising wave came in, rather than adjusting my settings, I pressed the remote shutter and got exactly the wave patterns I was imagining. No other subsequent exposure came even close to it, unfortunately, thus I had to choose this one despite its technical shortcomings.", "It can be quite difficult to capture waves because the shutter speed has to match the their force to shape beautiful streaks of spume, without them stopping or clumping up at a rock, breaking the rhythm of the lines. Oftentimes a shorter exposure doesn't create any dynamic addition to the image and a longer one would render most of the wave motion invisible.", "Here are the settings used for my shot:", " Nikon D800 ", " Nikkor AF-S 18-35mm F3.5-4.5 G ED ", " 18mm Shutter speed: 3,5 sec ", " F5.0 ", " 100 ", " Haida ND64", "I knew I needed to brighten the image overall, however I did not not want to alter the colors in any way to preserve the natural hues that the magical blur hour light supplied. Also, I knew I had to make local adjustments to the micro contrast, which is why I did not use clarity just yet because I wanted to keep the clouds nice and smooth.", "I rarely ever sharpen my whole image which is why I used a mid-range mask here to cover only the stronger contrasted edges of the rocks and sky. Even though I do use lens corrections I almost always dial down the distortion; on the one hand because the Nikon 18-35mm G ED has almost no distortion to begin with and on the other because a little distortion, in my opinion, adds to the dynamism of the image, especially in landscape photography. And for the most part I keep the standard noise reductions settings as is.", "Next I imported the image into Photoshop and here you already can see all the different adjustments I made to the image on the right (first switched off so you can see the difference). Before I start working on anything else, I usually get rid of dust spots - thus the base layer is renamed to \"clean\", indicating I've already cleaned up the image.", "As a second step I used Nik Color Efex Pro 4 here for some more global adjustments, and afterwards I used luminosity masks to target specific tonalities of the image, adding more contrast selectively to the sand and sky. Due to the very even overall exposure (not taking into account the rocks), most of the masks are not altered after the tonality selection.", "In Color Efex Pro 4 I first used the Pro Contrast and Detail Extractor with these settings:", "At this point I wanted to add a bit more contrast to the sky and the foreground without darkening the rocks to prevent having to brighten them up again later in the processing, since that is never a good idea to begin with. The rest of the image benefited from a little more punch overall, though. I also balanced out a little bit of the cyan toning with the 'Correct Color Cast' setting, because at this stage I felt like it might be deviating a bit too much from what the scene looked like in my recollection.", "The detail extractor is an incredibly powerful filter, which is why I seldom use it at more than 5%. I would also recommend painting the effect in rather than using control points for masking in more complex situations. But in this case, the selections that the program generated suited my needs and I went with it. I tried to prevent the detail extractor from brightening the waves and sky, as it tends to brighten darker parts of the image recovering information in the dark tones. Furthermore, longer exposed skies and waves looking too crisp, for me at least, often kind of defeat the purpose of taking long exposures in the first place. However, the dark rocks were already brightened up a little bit which was a desirable result in this case.", "After these adjustments the image already had more punch, but still lacked some differentiation in the narrow tonalities of the sand and the incoming surf – something common with blue hour shots. Additionally, I wanted the sky to be just a bit more dramatic. For this I added different curves layers with various luminosity masks generated with Tony Kuypers famous TK Panel.", "First, with a 'Lights 3' and a 'Lights 1' mask, I emphasized the waves in between the rocks, both grouped together and masked with a gradient in order not to affect the sky (you can see the gradient masks in the first screenshot).", "The same procedure was then used to get more detail out of the immediate foreground waves by using a 'Midtones 3', and again for the rocks, and foreground using a 'Darks 2' mask (this was actually applied later in the workflow and is called 'contr5' in the image above).", "Next I wanted to introduce a bit more drama to the sky, so I used a 'Midtones 3' mask in order to select a wide tonal range in the sky, and darkened them only a small amount to make the undersides of the clouds stand out more.", "In the end I darkened the rocks a little – just a tiny amount because I love images with prevalent darker tones – using a 'Darks 3' mask (this would've also simply been achieved by painting out the detail extractor added earlier).", "As a last step I added a minor dodge and burn alteration to call attention to the small water splashes on the right sea stack: a very subtle, almost unnoticeable effect.", "My final actions, as per usual, included resizing and converting into RGB color space. Usually I choose 900px for the web, but in this case I chose 1200px for this DPR article, so you can see more of the details.", "I hope you enjoyed this behind-the-scenes look at my process!"], "url": "https://www.dpreview.com/techniques/3763628593/behind-the-shot-nicolas-alexander-otto-and-the-living-infinite"},

And the room number was designed like a name tag - it said something like 'Hello, my name is Room 121'. And for whatever reason that inspired me, and I took it a different direction, and wondered what if that room number was a story that you felt connected to? And what if that story was a child's face, and what if by staying in that room you were sponsoring that child?", "So it started with that simple idea, and then as I was looking around that hotel room I started thinking, well, I know there are non-profits that make soaps, and shampoo... what if the TV showed inspiring documentaries from filmmakers all around the world... what if the Internet fee went to fight human trafficking... what if room service was connected to Food for the Hungry?", "I just had this lightbulb moment - what if everything was helping something?

{"title": "Quick Look: Parallelism in Landscape Photography", "content": ["Part of what can make an image both visually appealing and conceptually interesting is the connection between its different parts. An image is a whole made of differentiable elements, and these elements can either be separate or have a variety of relations between them. To make an image which is indeed a whole and not just different layers on top of each other, a photographer needs to make the layers (or elements) communicate with each other. But how? One way, which I will detail here, is parallelism.", "When pre-visualizing an image, especially its composition, one needs to take into account the possible similarities, or parallelisms, that the environment offers. For example, it’s very often that there is a lack of connection between the sky and the earth in a landscape shot. But a bold red-colored flower on the ground can parallel a setting sun in the sky, thus strengthening the connection between them and bonding heaven and earth in the image, which has clear philosophical and visual implications.", "But it’s not only color – shapes, lines and textures can also parallel each other – light rays in the clouds with lines in the sand, lenticular clouds with rounded pools, the options are endless. The important thing to keep in mind is to make these parallelisms stand out, making the viewer realize our intention in including them in the image.", "Parallelism can serve its goals even better if it is of a higher level: more than two parts of the image being parallel to each other in the same way or in different ways, or the same part being parallel in more than one way.", "See for example the second image shown here. There are two parallelisms: firstly there’s the one made by the architects who chose to make the famous lighthouse of Kalfshamarsvik, Iceland resemble the basalt columns in the area it was built on. Secondly, the yellow patch in the midst of the dark: on the ground – the yellow vegetation. On top – the light coming out of the lighthouse. Both share color and both stand out of their dark, gloomy, lava-column-shaped surroundings. The choice of dark exposure made these elements stand out even more, strengthening the bond between them and the image’s integrity.", "Another good example can be seen in the third image. The parallelism between the shadow cast by the center tree and the flare caused by the sun bonds the ground and the sky, which are in turn both bonded to the main subject – the tree – in different ways: the flare touches and intersects the tree, while the shadow is caused by the tree.

I’m a photographer and I’ve been shooting movies for close to thirty years. I love shooting movies and taking still photos.", "EL: You know, one thing I can tell you is that I'm the worst geek in the world! Sometimes I don't even know how to turn on the camera. [Laughs, obviously joking] But from an instinctive, craftsman point of view, whenever I'm going to start a movie or buy a camera or start a project, I do a lot of tests. All these test help inform me of how I want to shoot the movie, which equipment I'm going to use, how I'm going to mix equipment and so on. Like how my Nikon D810 works. After testing it and comparing it to other cameras I know what that camera can do for me as opposed to other cameras.", "EL: That's ", " why I picked it. One of the most important characteristics for any equipment that I'm going to use is how well it can capture high dynamic range. I’m an old cinematographer, so I was used to the high dynamic range of film. If you consider the high dynamic range of Kodak [negative] film, especially in the latest years, to be like the 88 keys of a piano, that was what I needed to go out and capture the highlights, the sky, the shadows in the subject's hair, and so on. ", "Then suddenly film started to collapse and disappear. It happened too early and it happened too fast. It was a result of the studios and the exhibitors going into digital exhibition, so suddenly there was no business for printing. That was the biggest businesses for the labs, so the labs started to close down. It became very hard to shoot film. ", "Unfortunately, the transition happened too early and the cameras weren't ready. The digital cameras that came out in the beginning (around 15 years ago) were not even close to the high dynamic range of film. I worked with a few directors, including Michael Mann, to do tests with digital video imaging. For certain things, we liked and used it, but it was primitive and it wasn’t ready to take over and become the main technology for capturing images.", "I think now we're in a very good place where the digital cameras are allowing us to do many things we couldn't do with film. But it's still the dynamic range - the high dynamic range - where digital cameras, as amazing as they are at capturing shadows and not having any noise, don’t allow you to capture those 88 keys of the piano I was used to. And movies get hurt by that.  ", "For example, the last movie I did [we were shooting] in the forest, and when looking at the sky I wasn't able to capture the little round ball of the sun and ", " capture the face of the actor. It's stressful for a cinematographer. So the idea of new sensor technology, like what InVisage has demonstrated in their QuantumFilm technology, that will allow us to go back to 88 keys of dynamic range or more is incredibly exciting.", "Shooting ", " in all natural light pushed the limits of dynamic range on the digital cameras used for the production.", "When InVisage approached me and showed me their sensor technology I got very, very excited. As people would say, it's music to my ears. Actually, it’s ", " what they are doing! What they’re attempting to do is everything I've been looking for, and that's why I'm so excited to work with them.", "The first thing I'm excited about is the high dynamic range of QuantumFilm, but the other thing that's important is a camera that has a global shutter as opposed to a rolling shutter. That's something that we suffered with a bit during Gravity. When you're doing a lot of digital effects and stitching things together, not having global shutter can become a big issue, as you guys know.", "EL: Absolutely. Very different. When I signed on to do ", ", I wanted to do all the day scenes on film, just because of the high dynamic range, and I wanted to do all the dusk and night scenes with a digital camera. That's because the digital cameras are more sensitive to light. They can see more in the shadows, and you can push them a bit. For example, let's say that Arri says their camera is ISO 800 native. You can shoot it at IS0 1600 and there's still no noise. You're able to shoot scenes at night with firelight, and you can capture the stars and the Aurora Borealis in the night sky - things that film couldn’t do.", "I started doing a lot of tests while we were rehearsing the movie, and every time I went back to the lab to see the results, the images I was capturing with the digital cameras were more interesting to me because they had less noise or no noise at all. It was like opening a window for the audience to get them immersed in this world, whereas film still had that poetic or romantic look, and the grain and texture was making the world of ", " look more romanticized. It wasn't really allowing me to get immersed into the world of these trappers the way the digital cameras did.", "Little by little I realized that I didn't want to shoot the movie on film. For a middle-aged cinematographer who’s been shooting for so many years - that's a very hard call. It's like suddenly saying to a musician “You know, forget about your incredible piano, you're going to play this concert with a Minimoog.” It's heart-breaking, but the images spoke for themselves. We sent all the film cameras and film back to Los Angeles and started shooting the rest of the tests with the digital cameras. What I learned really fast is that, as opposed to film, you expose differently. You can overexpose film, and for many years I overexposed film because I liked the way you could still see the highlights, and by overexposing I was able to bring up a little bit of information in the shadows.", "EL: Yes, exactly, which would then give you a little bit of extra latitude in the shadows. You would add a little noise by doing this, or grain in the highlights, but it was just a little bit and it allowed me to capture the whole '88 keys’ [of the piano].", "EL: Yes, it’s very different. You have to ", ".", "EL: That's exactly what you find when you start to test. And that testing tells you ", " much you can underexpose before you start to lose the shadows.", "Unfortunately, as I was telling you before, we’re at a moment where the cameras and the chips are just not ready enough. Let's say they are ready, but they don't have the high dynamic range that we would like to have. This was a very good movie to do this test because I wasn’t using extra light or artificial light, so I sometimes had to make a call and say \"OK, do I lose Leo's face or detail in his hair? Or do I lose a cloud that is front-lit and many, many stops brighter than what this camera could capture?\"", "So what I would do much of the time is go for Leo's face, because he's the star of the movie, and then I would do a second pass and capture the sky, hoping that later I could replace the sky in the scene. But obviously that’s very expensive and you can't do it over and over. The camera is handheld and it's moving, so tracking it [in ", " to overlay the two exposures] would become very hard. In still photography I do that a lot. You know, you take a portrait of somebody and if the background is way too overexposed you shoot a couple more shots.", "Before filming ", " Lubezki did extensive tests with his cameras in order to understand the dynamic range they were capable of handling and took advantage of clean shadow details to expose for the highlights.", "EL: Yes. Not in still photography, but what I do when shooting cinema is I create lookup tables [LUTs] that allow me to see how much information I still have in the shadows if I'm underexposed. They’re very easy to create if you shoot tests and then make 2D or 3D LUTs in order to see the shadows. I haven’t been able to do it in still photography because I would probably need to get into the camera and mess with the monitor.", "EL: Exactly. That gives you a ", " bit of an impression, but I've had a couple of hiccups where I think I still have enough detail, and then you open up the images in Photoshop and the shadows in the hair are already so underexposed that you don't see detail. I take photos more like a hobbyist than a great professional that has an assistant with a laptop. I just have my camera and shoot.", "EL: I ", " the 'film guy'. What I gained by shooting digital makes me much happier. That's why I sent the film cameras back to Los Angeles. The digital cameras were giving me something I could never have done on film - because of the sensitivity, because of the immediacy, and because Alejandro [Director Alejandro Iñárritu] was able to watch everything on large monitors. Sometimes when you have 400 extras you want to watch a playback and see what all those extras are doing and things like that. Things that film doesn’t give us.", "On ", " I was shooting at high latitudes - we were in Canada, north of Calgary, in the winter. Shooting in that part of the world, the sun is very low to the horizon and goes behind the mountains very early. By shooting with digital cameras I was able to add one or two hours of shooting to our very short days. That's a lot of extra time for a big production. It's millions of dollars that you don't lose by not being able to shoot. It was also during the time of day that's very mysterious and magical [the 'golden' or 'magic' hour], and by having the digital cameras I was able to capture things I couldn't do on film. ", "EL: I'm not trying to tell young filmmakers or any director to not shoot film. The ideal world would be a world where we have all these different tools - where you have film, where you have QuantumFilm sensors, where you have tiny digital cameras that have very little latitude - where you have all these paintbrushes that allow you to communicate and allow you to express different things. ", "It will be very sad to see film go away because we have 100+ years of film history and it would be a big loss if we couldn't print these movies anymore. You know, movies like ", ", or a movie like the Coen Brothers movie that just came out that is an homage to filmmaking - it was a good call by the filmmakers to make these movies on film. So it would be great to still have film, and it’s fantastic to be able to combine things. But in general, I feel much more comfortable shooting digital.", "At the start of production, Lubezki planned to shoot daylight scenes on film due to its high dynamic range, but after extensive testing sent all the film and film cameras back to Los Angeles and shot entirely on digital.", "EL: Absolutely! ", "EL: I think so. I think in general professional cinematographers working in the industry know that, and if not you learn it very fast. The first day of testing you realize that you're gaining a lot information by doing that.", "EL: Right now we're talking about professionals. But imagine - hopefully in the short future - if we had QuantumFilm in our phones, what amazing things we could do with them. How many millions or billions of photographs do we see everyday where the skies are clipped? Sometimes it doesn’t matter, but a lot of times it does because you're losing a great amount of information about the environment or the highlights in somebody’s face.", "EL: I'm very happy to hear that because it's something that I really wanted to show to the audience! Although you're specialists and are able to see it like that, I think even people that don’t see it the way you're seeing it… their subconscious is telling them \"This is different,\" and that it’s not artificially lit [to work around the capture medium's limitations], and that it's the real thing.", "Using digital cameras allowed Lubezki, shooting in extreme northern latitudes in the winter, to add an hour or two of filming each day during the magic hours when the sun was low to the horizon.", "EL: Yes. It's exactly those two things. We wanted the movie to be as naturalistic and immersive as possible. The long takes, the digital equipment, and the way it was exposed... all these things together worked really well.", "EL: I think you have to know a little bit about your equipment, at least in the way I do, in an intuitive way. You need to be able to test it and you need to know what you can do with it. I don't know if you necessarily need to know that the chip is connected with 27 cables into… I don't know if that's imperative. I wish I could learn it. I haven't had the time and the passion to open up a camera and go through exactly how it works, but I didn't do that on film either. To me the results were more important.

I decided to go back on Saturday afternoon as it was mostly overcast with more even contrast. This time the quad was buzzing.

The work represented by the 30 honorees is remarkable and continues to provide inspiration to photographers at all levels in the industry.”", "As 2014 Rising Star Erum Rizvi further explains the impact of the competition, “referrals, support and motivation is the key to staying relevant in this business.

Verity and I are both honored and humbled with this recognition.”", "During the WPPI conference, honorees, nominators and judges will all participate in a panel discussion to share their personal experiences, describe how they approach their work in a way that elevates them to an elite status, and what nominators were looking for when they submitted names to this year’s competition.

{"title": "Behind the Shot: Watery Grave", "content": ["In this article I'll take you to a grizzly scene I encountered, which enabled me to produce quite a rare shot. This image is special to me for two reasons: First of all, it's a very unique image, telling a story you don't come across very often. Secondly, I've had to put in work I usually don't do when it comes to post-processing, to make it look right. All in all, I'm happy with the result, and it has won good acclaim in international competitions and publications.", "The shot was taken back in February 2013. I was visiting the Snæfellsnes peninsula in western Iceland while scouting locations for my '", "' workshop, and the hotel owner told me about a terrible phenomenon. Tons upon tons of herring entered Kolgrafafjörður, one of the fjords near the town of Grundarfjörður, and simply suffocated from lack of oxygen in the fjord's water. This was sadly caused by man-made constructions which limited water (and hence oxygen) circulation in the bay. A very sad outcome indeed.", "I was wondering what the smell was about before being told, but as bad as it was, I had to see it for myself. When nearing the bay, the smell got worse until I got severely nauseated. There was no option but to walk on countless dead herring, not a pleasant experience if I might say so, but seeing the scene, I felt I could get a truly unique shot here, since this kind of thing only happens once every several years.", "Shooting conditions were dismal. The moist air destroyed visibility, and the light situation in midday was not in my favor. Add to this the fact that I was feeling quite sick and couldn't stay for much longer, and the result was perhaps the \"worst good image\" I've shot. The Raw file doesn't look like what I want to convey here, not at all. But since I felt the image was special enough, I put some work in it, and transformed it into something I'm proud of, and more importantly, tells a natural story in a visually compelling way.", "I took the image using my Canon EOS 5D Mark III and my Canon 16-35mm F2.8L II lens (at 16mm). I also used a Lee Pro Glass 0.9 ND, a Lee 0.9 soft grad and a 105mm Heliopan circular polarizer. The ND filter made the exposure longer, and the grad partially balanced the global contrast in the scene.", "This is a 1.3 second exposure at ISO 200, F16. The narrow aperture served to increase depth of field and to make the exposure longer in order to ensure the water was flat. The long exposure caused some movement of the fish- I actually like that, it contributes to the grizzly feel of the image in some way, and I think the amount of motion blur is quite adequate.", "Composition is pretty straightforward here, but there are a few points worth mentioning.", "First of all, the small rock at the foreground is a very important compositional element. It serves both as an anchor - a sharp, non moving object to complement and counter the blurred fish and water - and as a parallel to the mountain. In my eyes, the top and bottom parts of the image reflect each other, in that there's a solid object surrounded by a blurred mass: on top, the mountain range surrounded by clouds, and on bottom, a rock surrounded by water and dead fish. The position of the rock in the right side of the foreground was carefully selected to counterbalance the mountain, whose main mass is on the left.", "Another thing I like here is how the seemingly infinite mass of fish slowly gives way to the mountain's reflection. Personally I find this compelling both visually and as a story-telling tool.", "As I've mentioned before, the quality of the original RAW file is quite poor here, and if it hadn't been such a unique image, I would have probably deleted it. But since I wanted to keep the shot, I needed to make the most of it in post processing, and this meant major retouching work which might upset some. It's important for me to mention that this is", "quite far from the amount of processing I usually allow myself to do, but when you look at it, all I really do here is enhance contrast, clarity and color - never really adding things that weren't there. Like it or not, I don't hide my process, so let's see what I did to make the image match my artistic vision.", "Most of the post processing of the image was done using Adobe Camera Raw version 8.1. I prefer working with ACR since the changes you make to the image are both easily traceable and individually undoable. First let's see the untouched RAW file. ", "The initial steps were automatic lens correction and cropping the image slightly to balance the composition.", "To enhance the drama in the image I even added some post-crop vignetting. This served to darken the margins and create a gloomier atmosphere.", "Now begins the heavier processing. First I needed to counter the poor visibility, which ruined saturation and contrast. I boosted the image's contrast, clarity, saturation and vibrance.", "This resulted in exaggerated saturation in some parts of the image, but I'll deal with that later. First I need to make I have enough saturation where I need it.", "Next came quite a few local adjustments. Let's review them in a series of screenshots.", "After finishing work in ACR, I saved the file as a TIFF and opened it in Photoshop.", "The image still looks too bright to my eyes, and the dark solemn look I'm going for is not yet complete. I need to darken the image, but avoid losing detail where it's already dark. I did that by darkening only the not-so-dark parts of the image. The process was already explained on my article '", "', but I'll explain again quickly.", "First, I needed to create a selection restricted to the very dark pixels. This was done by inverting the image (duplicate layer, then ctrl-I), and creating a selection of the brightest pixels of the inverse image. This is done by ctrl-clicking the channel mask (channels view), and then multiplying the selection by itself several times by Ctrl-Alt-Shift-clicking on the channel mask.", "By using this mask for a levels adjustment layer, I could darken the image without losing detail.", "Now it looks very gloomy, exactly what I wanted.", "To finish the work and prepare the image for internet-use, I converted the color space to sRGB, performed size-reduction and some sharpening and I was done.", " is a professional nature photographer, photography guide and traveler based in Israel.

Indeed, in classic landscape photography the foreground element is usually the dominant component of an image, and serves it in many forms.", "The foreground connects us to the photographer's immediate environment by attracting the viewer to look at it. This eye-drawing quality stems from the fact that the foreground element is usually preferred to be massive (and is also inflated by the proximity to the lens), particularly detailed and interesting and also separated from the other image components. In addition, the foreground, when added to the background, contributes to the feeling of depth in the two-dimensional medium of photography. I always advise photographers to put a large emphasis on the qualities and location of the foreground element.", "But what if the very essence of the foreground was its nonexistence - or at least its extreme subtlety? What if the dissolution of the all-important element gave us more than its inclusion? I'm not talking about faraway landscapes without foregrounds. These are a different story altogether, and the lack of foreground is granted.", "What I'm talking about are images which have room for foreground, but whose massive, detailed, classical foreground element is missing, thus achieving a special feel - and an understanding that the exclusion of something so prominent can lead you to fascinating grounds.", "Both images included here are good examples of what I'm trying to say. The first shows the Pyramid Mountain, Kirkjufell, in the Snæfellsnes Peninsula, west Iceland. Some might say that the mountain itself is the foreground, but that's just not true. It's too far away, too much a part of the background, even more so since it integrates so well with the Milky Way and Aurora above it.", "The foreground consists of mainly nothing - joined by a few reflections of stars here and there. I claim that it's this very near-nothingness that gives the image its unique, spacey feel.

But this is different. We’re losing an historic, picture-powered publication.", "People in the newsroom have very little power over this sort of thing. This has nothing to do with the people over there producing the magazine. You look at Sports Illustrated, and what does everyone always say? Its about the images.

I really don’t think someone like Robert Beck is going to stay out of work and not be able to make another dollar from here on out just because he just got laid off from Sports Illustrated. Things change, and he’s such a good photographer and he’s been a legend for so long that I don’t think he’s going to have a problem. And the same goes for the other five photographers.", "What do I think will happen? That’s an interesting question. Obviously the SI will be using freelancers and wire imagery but the whole beauty of a team of photographers putting out consistent work, working together is that there’s a consistent look to the coverage. And when you start hiring different freelancers and using wire content that intermixes with everything else… there’s nothing wrong with that, but the sports coverage is going to start looking like everyone else’s. Because the guy who’s shooting for SI today might have shot for Getty yesterday, and another place the day before. ", "Of course they’ll continue to publish amazing content.

", "Here's the full story: In 1984, Rentmeester was assigned to photograph a then college-age Michael Jordan for ", ". The gig was a freelance assignment and Rentmeester retained the rights to the image. Later that year, Nike approached Rentmeester about using two of the 35mm transparencies from the shoot for marketing. Rentmeester was paid $150 for the limited use. A few months later, Nike gave Rentmeester an additional $500 to continue using the image.", "In February 1985, Nike reshot the Jordan jump photo. ", ", it certainly looks like Nike's version could be based on the original by Rentmeester. He seemed to think so too, and sued Nike. In the end, he was awarded $15,000 and Nike was given a two year license to continue using their reshot Jordan image. That image of course became the basis for the modern Jordan Jumpman logo we've all come to know.", "The original Rentmeester photo of Jordan shows the soon-to-be famous basketball star dunking not in his normal game-day style, but rather in a manner directed specifically by Rentmeester. The look Rentmeester wanted was similar to a ballet technique known as ‘grand jeté,' which is a long horizontal jump where the individual does a split mid-air.  ", "Rentmeester registered his original image with the United States copyright office a little over a month ago, more than likely in preparation for this lawsuit. But is 30 years too long for him to make a legitimate claim? It's hard to say.", "We reached out to  attorney ", " for an expert opinion. Read his statement below.", "Bert P. Krages is an Oregon-based attorney  specializing in intellectual property law, photographers' rights and environmental law. He has several books to his name including, '", " ", "His Website also includes a ", "that lists out the rights photographers should expect in the public domain.", "\"This is certainly an interesting case. Copyright cases can be deceptively complicated and this one has more complications than most. One of the elements of copyright infringement is that an ordinary observer would have to find the works to be substantially similar, or expressed another way, that the 'total concept and feel' of the works are substantially the same.", "At one level, the Nike photo and logo are similar to the Rentmeester photo in that they depict a basketball player in midair with extended legs and holding the ball high over his head with his left arm. On the other hand, the Nike photo and the logo show Jordan with straight legs and arms whereas the Rentmeester photo shows some curvature in the legs and left arm. Also, in the Rentmeester photo the right arm is held near shoulder level instead of at waist level. So the major issue in this case could come down to whether the Nike photo and logo are seen substantially as copies or as independently-created variations of a jumping basketball player. Cases involving 'recreations' or 'borrowings' of existing works have gone both ways, depending on the nature of the subject, the degree of similarity, and how the copied portion is used. ", "Another issue is the length of time that has passed between the time the alleged infringements began and the filing of the lawsuit. According to the complaint, Rentmeester accused Nike of infringing the photograph in 1985 and was paid $15,000 for a two year license. The Nike photo and logo were used long after 1987 but no suit was filed until 2015. Although the length of time alone is not a defense to liability in this matter because Nike continues to use the works, it could be a grounds by which the court could limit damages significantly. ", "Finally, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (which is the relevant appellate court) issued an opinion last year in the Garcia v. Google case in which they held that an actress had a copyright interest in a film because her performance required creativity. Although this opinion has been widely criticized, and may be retracted by the Ninth Circuit before too long, it will be interesting to see if Michael Jordan is interjected into the case. According to the complaint, Jordan was basically striking a choreographed pose when Rentmeester took the photo. If Jordan claims a copyright interest in the work, it is possible that he could assert it in a manner that would benefit Nike.\"", "We'll keep our eyes on this case and update you when we find out more.

Available only in the US at present, this website promises to bring customers in direct contact with local photographers while making the search free and easy to use. For a yearly fee, photographers can maintain a listing for their business with a selection of photos. Potential clients search for photographers by location and specialty, in much the same way you'd look for Thai restaurants in your neighborhood on Yelp.", "Does it live up to its claims, and is it worth a not-unsubstantial investment of $400 per year? We took the service for a test spin from a photographer's perspective. ", "Photographer Central key features", "In Use", "The Photographer Central website is attractive and easy to navigate. In fact, it's really easy to navigate. If you are unsure if you would like to use the service, Photographer Central allows you to set up a free account. The free account doesn't allow you to publish any of your information, but it does act as a good example of how simple the paid account is to create.", "Photographer Central offers two paid account options: a single listing for $400 annually (currently priced at $300) and multiple listings for $500 (currently $400). Setting up your account is fast. The website guides you through the process by asking for your contact information, a description of your photography business, and images that you would like included in your listing. ", "The site allows you to add numerous images to your listing, and if you already have a Zenfolio account you can easily transfer your images to the Photographer Central website. Otherwise, you can choose to upload the images yourself. Again, the upload process is simple and quick.", "Based on the address you provided, Photographer Central also allows you to define your service area. You have the freedom to include a wide service range if you desire, and can also indicate your availability to travel outside of that area.", "Once you are finished adding your information just click send and your listing is published. It's as simple as that. Once published, the site reports the performance statistics of your listing. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to put this feature to the test, as the site only ever told me it was still in the process of gathering performance statistics.", "As I stated in the previous section, Photographer Central is an attractive website that is very easy to use, and that holds true for potential clients seeking photographers. The homepage is dominated by a search bar with fields for location and specialty. Once you have entered your parameters, a list of photographers is populated. From this list you can browse through the photographers to find one that suits your needs. Once you find photographers that interest you, you can save them to your favorites for future reference.", "Photographer Central claims to be the most comprehensive online directory of professional photographers. And it just might be… eventually. Although the website is easy to use, there are several things that need to be considered before investing in it as a photographer.", "The cost of an account is not unreasonable if there is actually a return on your investment. However, when searching for local photographers on Google and Bing, Photographer Central did not show up in my search. In order for the website to draw prospective clients to your doorstep, they need to be one of the first websites listed in your search results. If not, you are advertising with a company that has little exposure. While the website looks attractive, that alone will not bring additional clients to a photographer. ", "Another issue I found with the website was the broad range of locations it returns in search results, despite inputing a small search area. When I searched 'Fairfield, Ohio' the site said there were 103 photographers near me. I was surprised by the sheer number of photographers in my city, so I clicked to view the results. The photographers listed in the search results spanned from Illinois to Tennessee - both within a day's drive of Southwest Ohio, but well beyond what you'd reasonably consider to be 'local'. ", "I checked to make sure I requested the correct area, but the site showed I requested photographers within a 30 mile radius. Results can be refined by narrowing search range down to 10 or zero miles, but this may not be immediately obvious to the user. And even with search area narrowed to zero miles, results may still include those photographers in neighboring states who have (presumably) set a very large travel area.", "This is a problem for both the consumer and the photographer. From the client standpoint, it's hard to decide what photographer to choose when the search results are so vast, and some clients may prefer the ability to choose from photographers in their immediate area, regardless of a photographer's willingness to travel from two states away. From the photographer's standpoint, it's frustrating to be grouped in with such a large number of photographers located in such an expansive area.", "Summing up", "Overall, I think Zenfolio's new venture has potential, but it will take a greater presence in Google's search results to make photographers feel that they have a good return on their investment. A $400 yearly fee for a single listing isn't chump change for a vast majority of working photographers looking to increase their sales reach. That fee would be well worth it if a listing yielded positive results, but at the moment Photographer Central doesn't appear to offer enough exposure to justify its price. "], "url": "https://www.dpreview.com/articles/2014130205/quick-review-zenfolio-photograher-central"},

{"title": "Behind the Shot: Spot the Shark", "content": ["In this article I'd like to talk about 'Spot the Shark' - a personal favorite of mine, and one of my most popular shots. I'm also extremely honored to have been approached by National Geographic to have it in an upcoming book release. With all the questions I've been getting about it, I decided to share the whole process:  the story behind the shot, how I took it and how I processed it at home. I hope you find the article helpful, perhaps even inspiring.", "I think the image is successful because it has a lot of attractive traits. The almost-monotone colors, the fullness caused by the ubiquitous receding water patterns and of course, the shark! The weird thing is that the ice shark is something I only noticed back home, believe it or not. It's really funny to think that the very thing that made this shot so special was a total accident :)", "But first thing's first. I took this image during late morning early in January 2013. I was guiding my first of two '", "' workshops that year, and we had finally arrived at one of the most popular shooting locations in Iceland: Breiðamerkursandur, the ice beach. When the participants were comfortable shooting by themselves, I went around and explored a bit. I took quite a lot of images, but eventually only kept 3 or 4 good ones. this is one of them.", "There are several points worth mentioning about the composition. I'll try to describe how I think it contributes to the image.", "Firstly, one can easily see that there are three anchor points here (marked by green ellipses): the large piece of ice in the foreground, the 'shark' and its surroundings and the patch of light in the sky. The anchors balance the image: the large one on the bottom right is countered by the two other smaller ones in the top-left.", "Secondly, there are many 'lines' (marked by red arrows), serving the flow of the image. The most obvious ones are those created by the water, and they add a lot, both in filling in the gaps between the anchors and in creating a sense of motion (which counters the stationary anchors in it own right). Additional lines can be seen in the sky: the cloud patterns seem to be moving away from the lit patch, adding motion and paralleling the lines on the ground.", "Finally, if you look closely, you might see a connecting pattern (marked by the yellow dotted line) curving its way from the lit patch, through the gushing ocean waves and the upper water patterns into the 'shark', and then on to the largest piece of ice. This serves to connect the different parts of the image and make them work well together.", "The day was pretty gloomy in terms of weather, with lots of heavy clouds, and just a small amount of color coming from between them. There was very little natural contrast, a fact I'd have to deal with later when post-processing, but there was a lot of ice spread everywhere on the beach. This fact helped a lot: I had the privilege of shooting at a place where the beach was very moderately sloped, which had a crucial function in the look of the image.", "The secret to the beautiful receding water patterns is exactly that: when the slope is moderate, incoming waves return to the ocean very slowly, and this allowed me to compose, stick my tripod deep into the sand and take the shot while there was still a lot of water moving around me. A long exposure captured the motion of the water to add a lot of content between the main subjects.", "I used my Canon 5D Mark III and a Canon 16-35mm f/2.8L II. I used a 0.9 solid ND to prolong the exposure and a 0.9 soft-edge graduated ND to balance the lighter sky. I took the shot at ISO 100 and f/16, and the exposure lasted 4 seconds - a bit on the long side but perfect for these specific conditions. Had the slope been greater, I'd have opted for a shorter exposure to get good details in the water patterns.", "Most of the PP work on this image was done on the RAW file using Adobe Camera Raw (ACR). Contrast work was critical, and I needed quite a few local adjustments to get the image just right. Here is the untouched RAW file.", "The first things I had to do were fix the lens aberration and straighten the horizon. I used ACR's automatic lens aberration correction option, and used the straighten tool to have the horizon right. While at it, I cropped the image to balance the composition.", "Next I needed to add some definition throughout the image. I did so by boosting contrast and clarity.", "All further corrections are local. I've done quite a few local corrections, but most of them fix very minor issues and so I won't be discussing them here. I do, however, wish to go over the important local adjustments.", "The main thing I did here is increase local contrast in the areas which needed it. The most important detail to bring out is the receding water patterns. I therefore boosted contrast and especially clarity in all the areas containing these patterns, as shown below.", "The ice needed a different treatment. To bring out its diamond-like qualities, I had to brighten it. I also increased contrast and clarity in the ice. The parameters might seem exaggerated, but remember that I had very little contrast to begin with.", "A very similar adjustment was made with the left part of the ice - the \"shark\" and its surroundings. I had to brighten it even more to make it more prominent - after all, it is the focus of the image, small as it may be.", "All other local corrections you can see above are much less significant, and were used to create some vignetting as well as fix some minor local issues.", "There wasn't much left to do here. The only thing I needed to take care of in Photoshop was the slight imbalance in the histogram: as you can see above, it lacks a black point. This was very easily fixed: I uploaded the image to Photoshop, created a levels adjustment layer and boosted the input levels to stretch the histogram a bit to the left.

Here's what he said. ", "My first introduction to photography was as a freshman in high school. But it really wasn’t until my freshman year in college that it started to take root as a passion and as a way of expressing myself as an artist.  ", "Well, I am to the core an artist that happens to use a camera and retouching tools like Photoshop.

I love people and I am drawn to making them look larger than life and making them look like a supermodel or superhero.  ", "Back in the mid 80's I started taking battery powered strobes with modifiers out into the field and shooting portraits. Back then this was considered really stepping outside of the box. My approach was primarily thinking in two layers or levels. The subject, which was lit by the strobe, and the background exposure, which was controlled by the shutter speed. If you look at those images, they almost look like a composite. I did this approach for 25 plus years. With the advancement of digital and Photoshop, it was a natural progression for me to move into compositing my images and shooting the two parts separately. ", "I wish I could tell you that I am so brilliant that I have it all mapped out ahead of time. But the truth is I am a bit of wing-it kind of person. I generally let the creative process just come together as I am working. However, I have a very specific look that I am repeating over and over again. With time, the refining of the look comes and people start to take notice.", "The single greatest thing you could do is to build a body of work that brands you as an artist. But most of us are not willing to take the risk in sticking with a look long enough to let that brand take root. We bounce around from idea to idea, from technique to technique. If you are aggressive, it takes around 3-5 years to really brand yourself in the marketplace. And a brand has around a 7-10 year life. So what does that say? That to be competitive in the marketplace and have a 30-40 year career, you need to be constantly working your butt off. There is no room for slackers at the top.

In 2022, Enoch traveled to Mumbai, India with a plan to photograph vendors selling neon pink cotton candy (also known as candy floss) on the streets.", "Through his research on the region, Enoch learned that the eye-catching pink sweets achieve their dreamy bright color because of unauthorized ingredients – like Rhodamine B, banned because it can be carcinogenic.", "'It could be said this is the perfect metaphor for the ills of our time,' Enoch says.", "Here he shares how he gained access to his subjects and worked quickly on the busy streets of Mumbai to capture these eye-popping portraits.", "I had planned the trip around the photography project. It’s somewhere I’ve always wanted to visit and I did a lot of research around portrait ideas, before coming up with the concept of the candy floss sellers.", "I tend to travel for project ideas in cities that are going through modernization – you get that unique juxtaposition of life changing in many ways, but remaining traditional in other ways. My last photography project was set in Hanoi, Vietnam, where authorities were looking to restrict motorbikes. In the city, motorbikes are used commonly to deliver huge loads of goods, delicately balanced on the bike. That project was a fantastic visual metaphor for how life could change for those delivery drivers.", "I was fascinated by the different sides of life in a city like Mumbai. On one hand, it’s one of the richest cities in the world and a huge financial hub, but of course on the other side, there are numerous slums and poverty. I wanted to capture a side to the city that wasn’t commonly seen.", "The men didn’t speak English so it was very hard to communicate, so we did get a translator. I paid them for their time as it’s really important not to take advantage and, well, everyone knows where they stand.", "I think because you're just getting them to do what they do anyway you can use the international language of mime. It was really just a case of putting in some legwork to track them down, finding the good ones and explaining what I was up to. Mostly the reaction was bemusement as for them this was just so everyday they were just baffled as to why I was interested.", "Not long at all, maybe 20 minutes with each person. I had already worked out where I would put them and had a good idea of how to light it before we started. We’d done the test shots before we found the right people so everything was already set up.", "There were actually multiple reasons for shooting at night. First, because I wanted to be able to control the lighting. If you're shooting in the daytime then you are going to have a lot of hard direct light to combat and that's going to be hard work and require quite a big setup to control.", "Secondly, I just like the aesthetic of that mixed lighting you get at night. The flash, the spill from the houses and shops all mixing together. I don’t want my portraits to look like traditional ‘travel photos’ so it works for me. It’s also an insanely busy city. If we shot those portraits during the day, we’d have crowds of hundreds of people around us – even at one or two in the morning we had quite a sizable number of onlookers to contend with. [Mumbai]'s a chaotic city 24/7, just a little less in the small hours.", "I’m using Profoto B1s dotted around with OCF attachments. For this sort of travel work I love the relative compactness.
