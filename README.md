# Information Retrieval System Project

## Overview
This project, a collaboration with Sofia d'Atri, designs an Information Retrieval (IR) system applying IR principles for effective digital information gathering, indexing, and retrieval based on user queries.

## Data Collection
Utilizing Scrapy, data was extracted from key photography sites:
- [DPReview](https://www.dpreview.com/)
- [Photography Life](https://photographylife.com/)
- [Expert Photography](https://expertphotography.com/)

## Storage and Indexing
Data is stored in MongoDB, chosen for scalability and flexibility, facilitating efficient management and retrieval.

## Search Engine Development
A Vue.js-based search engine with a FastAPI backend enhances user search experience, demonstrating seamless integration for query processing and information retrieval.

## Personalized Recommendations
The engine offers personalized content suggestions by tracking search history with cookies, improving user engagement through tailored recommendations.

## Theoretical Foundations
The project integrates IR theories like data clustering and algorithms for ranking search results, showcasing the application of IR principles in a practical, user-focused tool for discovering photography content.
